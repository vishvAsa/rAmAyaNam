The VR was likely composed in the span of three centuries (~5th century BC - 2nd century BC), though the broader Rāmākhyāna tradition is more archaic.

On the other hand, the Mahābhārata must have multiple distinct strata from 7th century BC up until the 3rd or 4th century AD.

## Kuśa and Lava
Kuśa and Lava might have been invented characters whose names were back-formed from the term kuśīlava ("bard"). 

Although later authors like Kālidāsa, Bhavabhūti, et al. typically refer to Lava and Kuśa by the dvandva Kuśa-Lavau, Vālmīki primarily uses "Kuśī-Lavau" to refer to them. The fact that Pāṇini didn't include Kuśa & Lava in "īd Agneḥ Soma-Varuṇayoḥ" (6.3.27, whence Agnī-Ṣomau, Agnī-Varuṇau) and neither Kātyāyana nor Patañjali thought to accommodate the usage Kuśīlavau in reference to Kuśa and Lava (rather than simply as dual of kuśīlava-, i.e. "the two bards") by supplementing this rule w/ a vārttika strongly suggests that none of the three were aware of the figures Kuśa & Lava. Grammarians take vibhāṣā from 6.3.24 as anuvṛtti into 6.3.27 in order to make it a vyavasthitavibhāṣā and thereby justify the existence of both dvandvas "Kuśī-Lavau" and "Kuśa-Lavau."

Overall, this implies that the characters Kuśa and Lava may not have been known even in the Śuṅga period.



In my opinion the term "kuśīlava" was originally a pejorative, i.e. one who is characterized by bad śīla or character, but was generalized to signify bard. There were a pair of bards who were critical in transmission of the Vālmīki's text and these were subsequently semi-divinized as children of Rāma. Yet the dual form was not yet "regularized," which led to this grammatical conundrum.

Alternatively, Kuśa and Lava could be entirely mythical and may've originally functioned as de-ritualized representations of two vīṇā players associated with the Aśvamedha who sing for a year, one being a Brāhmaṇa and the other a Rājanya/Kṣatriya ("brāhmaṇau vīṇā-gāthinau saṃvatsaraṃ gāyataḥ... brāhmaṇo 'nyo gāyati rājanyo 'nyaḥ," Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa 13.1.5).
