<details><summary>विश्वास-टिप्पनी</summary>

The below comments by mAnasatarangiNIkAra throw light on the connection between niyoga and ashvamedha – with particular reference to the birth of rAma. Also note ancillary remarks about how the epics can be interpreted as mirrors of the shruti; and how besides that, they must be read at many levels. And note the (very credible) theory that the current rAmAyaNa is a vaiShNava recasting of an aindra epic.

## Employment of ashvamedha for fertility
See it would need a long explanation to bring all the meta-points which I am not feeling inclined to now — it is something one could write a whole essay about but hardly my priority of things to write. but key points are it is clear from bAlakANDa

1st: tasya ca evam prabhAvasya dharmaj~nasya mahaatmanaH |  
sutArtham tapya mAnasya na asiit vaMshakaraH sutaH ||

He is clearly having a burning for the son who will extend the line — an anxiety. He has 3 wives but has not procreated. This is clearly a sign of a problem. Old tradition allows in these circumstances for an appointee with virtue to play the role of the sperm donor

Next point: chintayAnasya tasya evam buddhiH AsIn mahAtmanaH |  
sutArtham vAjimedhena kim artham na yajAmy aham ||

He now decides he should do vAjimedha for offspring. That is an unusual call for a horse-sacrifice. The horse sacrifice is normally done for a victorious king however we all know that the sexual rite at the heart of the ritual as well as the royal “fertilizing” yajuSh which is chanted to the horse implies that is always had a fertility angle which is what dasharatha is invoking rather than the martial one.

## ashvamedha as fertility rite
Now, this has deep roots in the Indo-European world with parallel sexual connotations in the horse rituals in other tradiitons e.g. in Rome

That is also clear from the obscene yajuSh recited when the queen lies near the horse:
ambe ambAlyambike na mA yabhati kashchana | sa sastyashvakaH | haye cha haye asau ||
Then in the ashvamedha the royal v2 women are given in hand symbolically to the v1 R^itvik-s and taken back after giving them the ritual dakShiNa-s. This again points to something of the deeper sexual ritual.

In the martial and standard ashvamedha it is only symbolic: but there is the horse phallus rite before that; all of this points to it once having a sexual significance that is only symbolic in the standard form. But note dasharatha clearly says he is performign the horse rite for offspring: an unusual but meaningful atavism.

### mahAbhArata comparison
Now it is not explicit as in the mahAbhArata where vyAsa fathers the protagonists (stated clearly) but the parallel is important: 1. vyAsa fathers on ambikA, ambAlikA and sUtA(names parallel to the chant in the ashvamedha see above). 2. He asks for a 1 year vrata ike horse ritual but they don’t observe and the outcome is a disaster.

## RShyashRnga
sumantra then specifically chooses R^ishyashri~Nga whose fertilizing nature like parjanya in the shruti (yo garbham oShadhInAm puruShINAM kR^iNoti…) is central to this tale: bring rain to the parched a~Nga. Now this same fertilizing R^ishyashR^i~Nga has to be brought to fertilize the barren “kshetra” of the ikShvAku monarch. That is the central motif there in his choice. This is then clarified by an interesting statement when romapAda sends his SIL:

shrutvA rAj~no.atha tat vAkyam manasA sa vichintya cha |    
pradAsyate putravantam shAntA bhartAram AtmavAn ||

Note that the emphasis is not on the ritual confering the son but the husband of shAntA being the putravAn i.e. the son-conferrer. Now that to me is notable: the one officiant is specifically called son-conferrer rather than being the performer of the ritual

### niyoga appeal
These are again almost mentioned as separate things when dasharatha humbly requests rishyashR^i~Nga: yaj~nArtham prasavArtham ca svargArtham ca nareshvaraH | for the sake of the ritual, for the sake of progeny and for the sake of heaven. Once the core horse ritual is done dasharatha says:

tato.abraviit R^ishyshR^i~Ngam rAjA dasharathaH tadA |  
kulasya vardhanaM tvaM tu kartum arhasi suvrata ||

This to me is telling the rite is done he has given wealth to vasiShTha and RShyashRnga both of whom have done their ritual duties then he explicitly says you have to do my kulavardhanam

I see no reason why not take it in the literal sense (given all the other context presented before) and see it as the closest to direct admission that he performed kulavardhanam

In line with about note again the emphasis on RShyashRnga in addition to the ritual:

tad ahaM yaShTum ichChAmi shAstra-dR^iShTena karmaNA ||  
R^iShi-putra-prabhAvena kAmAn prApsyAmi chApy aham |

He wants to perform rites ordained in scripture but also stress the “prabhAva” of the R^iShi-putra: this word can be interpretted in many ways but one way given the context is prabhAva as potency by which his desire of offspring is achieved

## putrakAmeShTi
Now that part of the putrakAmeShTi comes with a major vaiShNava interpolation into what was originally an aindra epic. Originally he is only talking of hayamedha giving offspring but suddenly this atharvan rite is now brought out with the divine payasam a euphemism for the fertilizing semen similar to the ghee of pururavas in the RV. This to me is the attempt to euphemize and introduce divinity into the narrative.

## Infertility of dasharatha
Having laid this base stuff from R bAla we come to your points:
Was dasharatha infertile: we do not know if he was infertile, having erectile issues or a more subtle immunological issue. These are part of the human condition and the text is clear that he was anxious about not having offspring and despite having 3 wives not having them is something to keep in mind.

Now if the hayamedha was sole for removing his sins there is no such explicit mention that he desired his sins to be removed: he says he wants to do it for offspring. 

## vAli-vadha

+++(वलस्यापत्यम् इति वालिः। )+++

There has been a lot of discussion about the deceitful killing of vAlin by rAma. Despite the justifications which rAma offers they seem hollow. However, after some thought I concluded that vAlmIki purposefully presented it that way. As we have seen he closely follows the shruti & repeatedly tries to illustrate the indra-nature of the ikShvAku prince by paralleling the acts of indra in the shruti. This I believe represents that side of indra which is hard to grasp for the unrealized:

> बह्वीः सन्धा अतिक्रम्य  
> दिवि प्रह्लादीयान् अतृण्  
> अहम् अन्तरिक्षे पौलोमान्  
> पृथिव्यां कालकाञ्जान् ।  
> तस्य मे तत्र न लोम चनामीयत ।


I guess a later day votary felt similarly about the slaying of vAlin as an Arya of yore might have felt when he heard the above shruti-vAkya-s: perhaps, even a sense of awe.

More precisely, there is a separate orthogonal element here. To establish the aindra nature of rAma, vAlmIki has him supersede the otherwise most powerful character in the epic vAlin (perhaps even most powerful in direct combat) who is the prior occupant of the aindra status.

## Multi-level interpretation
... I’ve said that an epic can be read at many levels

Now if you want to historicize it you have to be tethered to biological realities; hence, when coupled with dasharatha’s condition we have to come to the reading as above of a direct agency of r in generating the offspring

### A mirror of shruti
That is my intention of itihAsa-s read in the divine sense as a mirror of the shruti. In that type of reading rishyashR^i~Nga is like the udgAtR^i coming from the forest reciting the shakvarI sAman to generate rain. that’s for romapAda. In the same way like the udgAtR^i in the somayAga he brings indra (and other deva-s) to the ikShkvAku-s in the rAmAyaNa; laksh being viShNu, bharata being probably bhaga and shatrughna being aryaman

What is the shruti cognate of rAma piercing the 7 trees?

>  (KYV-TŚ) the story of Indra piercing 7 mountains to kill a boar-asura.

There is an RV reflex too.

> विश्वेत्ता विष्णु॒राभ॑रदुरुक्र॒मस्त्वेषि॑तः ।  
श॒तं म॑हि॒षान्क्षी॑रपा॒कमो॑द॒नं व॑रा॒हमिन्द्र॑ एमु॒षम् ॥

dyutAna mAruta - mArutiH?


## Conclusion
What I will not go into is all the meta-information. So when we opt for a historicized reading then this role of rishyashR^i~Nga falls out as I’ve stated.
