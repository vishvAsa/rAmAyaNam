अक्कटा रावणु ब्रह्म हत्य नीकु नेडदि  
पुक्किट पुराण लिंग पूज नीकु नेडदि

गुरु हत्य ब्रह्म हत्यन् गूडि द्रोणाचार्यु वंक  
हरि नी क्रुप नर्जुनुकवि लेवाय  

यॆरवुगा गल्ललाडि येचिन धर्म राजुनकु  
परग नी यनुमतिन् पापमु लेदायनु

अदिवो रुद्रुनि ब्रह्म हत्य बायन् गासि इच्चि  
पॊदलिन नीवतनि बूजिंतुवा  

अदनन् पार्वतीदेवि कातंडे नी मंत्रमिच्चॆ  
वदरु माटल माया वचनालेमिटिकि

तगिलिन नी नाममे तारक ब्रह्ममै  
जगमु वारि पापालु संततमू बापन् गानु  

मिगुल श्री वेंकटेश नेड मीकु पातकालु  
नगुन् बाटु लिंते काक नाना देशमुल


## Background:

Annamayya in this kirtana BANGS the people who believe that Lord Rama worshipped God Siva. There was a foolish story told by some bludy upanyasakas (preechers), who dont know what the truest essence of the vedopabrimhanas (smrithi, ithihasa, puranas). It goes like "Rama killed Ravanasura (a rakshasa, who is also a brahmin ), with which he got Brahma hatya patakam (  ). So to get rid off from this patakam , Rama worshipped God Siva at Rameswaram". This is condemned by our Annamacharya like anything॥॥he uses the Blasting words "pukkiti puranamulu (baseless, meaningless stories )", and those who tells this story are "vadarubothulu" (rascals saying blablbabla) and finally it is "nagubaatu" (siggupada valasina vishayam, felt to be ashamed of).

PS: Even now i am afraid of Annamayya , bcs i told this foolish story now to all of u ppl. But i feel we need to know this , so that whenever any rascal says this again to our community members, we too can bang them with the help of our great Annamacharya's kirtana.


## Meaning
अक्कटा रावणु ब्रह्म हत्य नीकु नेडदि  
पुक्किट पुराण लिंग-पूज नीकु नेडदि

O Lord Narayana ! AyyayyO ! how can it be a great sin to you, the killing of Ravana. All the stories which tells that you worshipped god Siva to get rid off from the above said sin are baseless and meaningless only.


गुरु हत्य ब्रह्म हत्यन् गूडि द्रोणाचार्यु वंक  
हरि नी कृपन् अर्जुनुकवि लेवाय 

O Hari ! Arjuna killed his Guru, who is also a brahmin - but he did not even touched by the traces of that sins just because of your blessings only.

यॆरवुगा गल्ललाडि येचिन धर्म राजुनकु  
परग नी यनुमतिन् पापमु लेदायनु

O Narayana ! Yudishtira (dharmaraju) told one lie in the battlefield, but he did not get that sin because there was your permission to do so.


Hence, from above examples, the sin is defined as the act that is against the will and wish of Lord Narayana. If i elaborate this too much, it becomes too technical and uneasy for some fellows, so i want to stop it here itself.

अदिवो रुद्रुनि ब्रह्म हत्य बायन् गासि इच्चि  
पॊदलिन नीवतनि बूजिंतुवा

O Lord Narayana ! see there (adivo) at the starting of this srishti, when rudra plucked one of the ५ heads of Brahma, you only relieved him from that sin by taking him to Gaya and make him doing pitrukaryam there. You being such a reliever of rudra's sin, how can u worship siva?.


(when brahma cameout from Narayana's navel, he has ५ heads॥.after brahma created rudra, rudra plucked the head on the top of brahma, thus brahma became ४ headed since then).

अदनन् पार्वतीदेवि कातंडे नी मंत्रमिच्चॆ  
वदरु माटल माया वचनालेमिटिकि

Even he (Rudra) only gave ur mantra (taraka mantramua) to his wife Parvathi devi (who chants rama namam always). So this is the proof that YOU did not worship rudra. Why to go for bludy rascal's (vadaru bothulu) foolish and baseless words.


तगिलिन नी नाममे तारक ब्रह्ममै  
जगमु वारि पापालु संततमू बापन् गानु

O Narayana ! Just with the touch of YOUR namam, the sins of the people of whole universe will vanish.

मिगुल श्री वेंकटेश नेड मीकु पातकालु  
नगुन् बाटु लिंते काक नाना देशमुल

O Sri Venkatesa ! Such a sinless are YOU, where is the chance of getting sins to you. All these foolish sayings are the things to be ashamed of their ignorance. Nothing more than that.
