Actual argument would be -

If there were female upanayana in R, it would be described +
There is no description of female upanayana in the Ramayana   => the author of the Ramayana never conceived of female upanayana.

Seems quite reasonable to me. If V finds R's upanayana of note and describes it, no doubt he would do the same for S.

There are lot of other absences - absence of female Rtvik-s, female warriors (other than likes of tATakA and shUpraNakhA), famale ministers, female AchArya-s etc..

## Probability calculation
Just for fun -

Events U = S's upanayana
K = described in rAmAyaNa

Bayes theorem IIRC -  
P(U|~K) = P(~K|U)P(U)/(P(~K|U)P(U) + P(~K|~U)P(~U))

Prior probability P(U) = 0.05
P(~K|~U) = 1
P(~K|U) = 0.01

P(U|~K) = .01*.05/(.01*.05 + 1*.95) = 0.00052603892

Been a long time since I did this - so if there is an error, please let me know.
