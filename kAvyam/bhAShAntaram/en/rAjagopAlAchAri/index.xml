start=&#34;76&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Epilogue&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;authors-preface&#34;&gt;AUTHOR&amp;rsquo;S PREFACE&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has&#xA;added to the debt of gratitude owed it by&#xA;undertaking the publication of the English&#xA;version of my Tamil Ramayana. They&#xA;achieved great success in the distribution&#xA;of my Mahabharata book and I trust this&#xA;book of the story of Rama and Sita will&#xA;receive similar welcome.&#xA;Once again, I repeat my confession that&#xA;in the evening of my busy life during a&#xA;great and eventful period of Indian&#xA;history, the writing of these two books&#xA;wherein I have retold the Mahabharata&#xA;and Ramayana, is, in my opinion, the best&#xA;service I have rendered to my people.&#xA;At any rate, they embody the best joy I&#xA;have experienced; for in these two books I&#xA;helped our great sages to speak to our dear&#xA;men and women again in their own&#xA;language, elevating their minds through&#xA;the sorrows borne by Kunti, Kausalya,&#xA;Draupadi and Sita. The real need of the&#xA;hour is a recommunion between us and&#xA;the sages of our land, so that the future&#xA;may be built on rock and not on sand.&#xA;In presenting this English version to a&#xA;wider circle of readers spread all over the&#xA;world, I think I am presenting to them the&#xA;people of Bharat just as they are, with all&#xA;their virtues and their faults. Our classics&#xA;really embody our national character in all&#xA;its aspects and it is well the world sees us&#xA;as we really are, apart from what we wish&#xA;to become.&#xA;The Ramayana is not history or&#xA;biography. It is a part of Hindu&#xA;mythology. One cannot understand Hindu&#xA;dharma unless one knows Rama and Sita,&#xA;Bharata,&#xA;Lakshmana,&#xA;Ravana,&#xA;Kumbhakarna and Hanuman. Mythology&#xA;cannot be dispensed with. Philosophy&#xA;alone or rituals alone or mythology alone&#xA;cannot be sufficient. These are the three&#xA;stands of all ancient religions. The attitude&#xA;towards things spiritual which belongs to&#xA;a particular people cannot be grasped or&#xA;preserved or conveyed unless we have all&#xA;these three.&#xA;The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has&#xA;achieved great work by the very wide&#xA;distribution organised by it of my&#xA;Ramayana and Mahabharata books, which&#xA;seek to bring Valmiki and Vyasa near to&#xA;those who have no access to the unrivalled&#xA;original classics. The characters and&#xA;incidents of these two itihasas have come&#xA;to be the raw material for the works of&#xA;numerous poets and saints that came later&#xA;to write dramas and sing poems and&#xA;hymns to keep this nation in the straight&#xA;path.&#xA;Oral discourses have further played&#xA;with them in order to entertain and&#xA;instruct pious audiences and not a few&#xA;variations and additions have been&#xA;made to the original. All the languages&#xA;of India have the Ramayana and&#xA;Mahabharata retold by their poets, with&#xA;additions and variations of their own.&#xA;They are the records of the mind and&#xA;spirit of our forefathers who cared for&#xA;the good, ever so much more than for&#xA;the pleasant and who saw more of the&#xA;mystery of life than we can do in our&#xA;interminable pursuit for petty and&#xA;illusory achievements ill the material&#xA;plane.&#xA;We should be thankful to those who&#xA;preserved for us these many centuries-old&#xA;epics in spite of all the vicissitudes&#xA;through which our nation passed since&#xA;Vyasa and Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s time. Even the poets&#xA;who wrote these epics in the original did&#xA;not create but built out of the inherited&#xA;bricks of national memory prior to their&#xA;own time. Reading the Ramayana and&#xA;Mahabharata even in the form I have&#xA;given them, we go back to live with our&#xA;ancient forbears and listen to their grand&#xA;voice.Mythology is an integral part of&#xA;religion. It is as necessary for religion and&#xA;national culture as the skin and the&#xA;skeleton that preserve a fruit with its juice&#xA;and its taste. Form is no less essential than&#xA;substance. Mythology and holy figures are&#xA;necessary for any great culture to rest on&#xA;its stable spiritual foundation and function&#xA;as a life-giving inspiration and guide.&#xA;Let us keep ever in our minds the fact&#xA;that it is the Ramayana and the&#xA;Mahabharata that bind our vast numbers&#xA;together as one people, despite caste,&#xA;space and language that seemingly divide&#xA;them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To the north of the Ganga was the great&#xA;kingdom Kosala, made fertile by the river&#xA;Sarayu. Its capital was Ayodhya, built by&#xA;Manu, the famous ruler of the Solar&#xA;dynasty. From Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s description of&#xA;the capital Kosala, it is clear that ancient&#xA;Ayodhya was not inferior to our modern&#xA;cities. Even in ancient India city&#xA;civilisation had reached a high level.&#xA;King Dasaratha ruled the kingdom&#xA;from the capital city of Ayodhya. He had&#xA;fought on the side of the Devas, and his&#xA;fame spread in the three worlds. He was&#xA;the equal of Indra and Kubera. The people&#xA;of Kosala were happy, contented and&#xA;virtuous. The land was protected by a&#xA;mighty army, and no enemy could come&#xA;anywhere near&#xA;It contained forts with moats around&#xA;them as well as many defensive&#xA;intallations, and true to its name, Ayodhya&#xA;defied all enemies. (Ayodhya means that&#xA;which cannot be subdued by war).&#xA;Dasaratha had eight wise ministers, ever&#xA;ready to advise him and execute his&#xA;orders. Great sages like Vasishtha and&#xA;Vamadeva and other Brahmanas taught&#xA;the dharma and performed rituals and&#xA;sacrifices.&#xA;Taxes were light and punishment of&#xA;crime was just and inflicted according to&#xA;the&#xA;capacity&#xA;of&#xA;the&#xA;wrong-doer.&#xA;Surrounded by the best counsellors and&#xA;statesmen, the king&amp;rsquo;s splendor shone as the&#xA;rising sun. Many years rolled smoothly&#xA;by. In the midst of all this prosperity&#xA;Dasaratha had one regret; he had no son.&#xA;One day in early summer he thought of&#xA;performing a horse sacrifice for progeny.&#xA;He consulted his religious masters and on&#xA;their advice, got sage Rishyasringa to&#xA;perform the Yaga. The Yaga was a grand&#xA;affair and the invitees included many of&#xA;the kings of the day. It was no easy thing&#xA;to perform yagas. The location and&#xA;erection of the sacrificial platform had to&#xA;be attended to in detail strictly according&#xA;to prescribed rules. There were experts&#xA;whose guidance was sought in arranging&#xA;things.&#xA;It meant the building of a new camp-&#xA;city, capable of accommodating tens of&#xA;thousands and providing hospitality and&#xA;entertainment for the invitees who&#xA;included the princes and sages of the land.&#xA;In short, yagas in those days were&#xA;something like our present-day State-&#xA;sponsored big scale conferences and&#xA;exhibitions.&#xA;When all arrangements were complete&#xA;the ceremonies were set in motion strictly&#xA;as enjoined by the Shastras.&#xA;Contemporaneously with the yaga in&#xA;Ayodhya, there was a conference of the&#xA;Devas in heaven. The Devas complained&#xA;to Lord Brahma that Ravana, king of the&#xA;demons, drunk with the power acquired&#xA;by the boon granted to him by Brahma,&#xA;was causing them untold misery and&#xA;hardship. They represented to Brahma: &amp;ldquo;It&#xA;is beyond our capacity to subdue, conquer&#xA;or kill Ravana. In the security of your&#xA;boon, he has grown wicked and insolent&#xA;and ill-treats all, even women. His desire&#xA;is to dethrone Indra. You are our onlyrefuge and it is for you to devise a method&#xA;by which Ravana can be slain and his&#xA;despotism ended.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brahma knew that he had granted to&#xA;Ravana the boon prayed for by him that&#xA;he should be invulnerable and invincible&#xA;against Devas, Asuras, Gandharvas and&#xA;other such beings. In his arrogance,&#xA;Ravana did not care to ask for security&#xA;against mankind. As Brahma revealed this&#xA;fateful omission all the Gods rejoiced and&#xA;turned to Vishnu.&#xA;Absolutely surrendering themselves to&#xA;Hari, the Devas begged him to be born as&#xA;a man and put an end to Ravana and his&#xA;atrocities. Hari agreed and assured the&#xA;Devas that he would be born as four sons&#xA;of King Dasaratha who was then&#xA;performing a sacrifice for progeny. As the&#xA;ghee was poured into the fire and the&#xA;flames shot up to meet it, from out of the&#xA;flames came a majestic figure, resplendent&#xA;like the noonday sun, holding a bowl of&#xA;gold.&#xA;Calling King Dasaratha by his name,&#xA;the figure said: &amp;ldquo;The Devas are pleased&#xA;with you and are answering your prayer.&#xA;Here is payasam sent by the gods for your&#xA;wives. You will be blessed with sons if&#xA;they drink this divine beverage.&amp;rdquo; With joy&#xA;unbounded, Dasaratha received the bowl&#xA;as he would receive a child and distributed&#xA;the payasam to his three wives, Kausalya,&#xA;Sumitra and Kaikeyi.&#xA;He asked Kausalya to drink a half of&#xA;the payasam and he gave a half of what&#xA;remained to Sumitra. Half of what was&#xA;then lift was drunk by Kaikeyi, and what&#xA;remained was given to Sumitra again.&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s wives were happy, even as a&#xA;beggar suddenly coming upon buried&#xA;treasure. And in due course all of them&#xA;were expectant mothers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In course of time, Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s sons&#xA;were born Rama of Kausalya and Bharata&#xA;of Kaikeyi. Sumitra gave birth to twins,&#xA;Lakshmana and Satrughna. She had drunk&#xA;the divine payasam twice.&#xA;In proportion to the quantity of&#xA;payasam drunk by the respective mothers,&#xA;the sons are traditionally considered to be&#xA;parts of Vishnu. Rama was thus half-&#xA;Vishnu.&#xA;But such calculations have no meaning,&#xA;as it is impossible to measure the Infinite&#xA;arithmetically. Sruit tells us that even a&#xA;fraction of the Supreme Being is whole&#xA;and complete by itself.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Om&#xA;Poornamadah&#xA;Poornamidam&#xA;Poornat Poornamudachyate Poornasya&#xA;Poornamadaya Poornamevavasishyate.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is whole, this is whole; what has&#xA;come out of the whole is also whole.&#xA;When the whole is taken out of the whole,&#xA;the whole still remains whole.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s four sons were given all the&#xA;training prescribed for princes. Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana were specially devoted to&#xA;each other and so were Bharata and&#xA;Satrughna. We can imagine that this&#xA;special attachment arose out of the way&#xA;the divine payasam was divided among&#xA;the King&amp;rsquo;s wives. Dasaratha was happy to&#xA;see his four sons grow up strong, virtuous,&#xA;brave and lovable and with all other&#xA;princely qualities.&#xA;One&#xA;day&#xA;as&#xA;the&#xA;King&#xA;was&#xA;contemplating his sons&amp;rsquo; matrimony, ushers&#xA;rushed in to announce that the great Sage&#xA;Viswamitra had arrived to see him.&#xA;Viswamitra was held in awe by all as the&#xA;most powerful among rishis.&#xA;Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s arrival at Ayodhya was&#xA;unexpected; and King Dasaratha stepped&#xA;down from his throne and advanced a few&#xA;paces respectfully to receive the sage.&#xA;Viswamitra was a king who attained&#xA;sainthood through terrible austerities. He&#xA;had long ago exhibited his spiritual&#xA;powers by starting to create another&#xA;Brahma and a rival universe. He had goneas far as the creation of new&#xA;constellations, but was prevailed upon to&#xA;stop by the entreaties of the alarmed gods.&#xA;Viswamitra, while he was king once&#xA;went out with his army and chanced to&#xA;visit Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s ashrama. The rishi&#xA;cordially welcomed his royal guest and&#xA;his huge entourage and extended to them&#xA;all hospitality so sumptuous that the King&#xA;wondered where all the rich abundance&#xA;came from in a forest hermitage.&#xA;Questioned by him, Vasishtha called&#xA;his cow Sabala and explained that she was&#xA;the fountain of unfailing plenty.&#xA;Expressing gratitude to the sage, King&#xA;Viswamitra said: &amp;ldquo;You must give me this&#xA;cow as she would be more useful with me&#xA;than with you. Such things of power and&#xA;wealth by right belong to the King.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Now Vasishtha could not part with the&#xA;divine cow. He gave many reasons and&#xA;asked the King not to press his request.&#xA;But the more unwilling Vasishtha was to&#xA;give the cow, the more eager the King&#xA;became to possess her.&#xA;Failing in his efforts to tempt or&#xA;persuade the sage to part with the cow,&#xA;Viswamitra became angry and ordered his&#xA;men to seize the cow by force.&#xA;Sabala could not understand why she&#xA;was being roughly handled and she was&#xA;unwilling to go away from the sage and&#xA;his ashrama. Shedding tears, she&#xA;wondered how she had offended&#xA;Vasishtha that he should stand by and&#xA;look on while she was being dragged&#xA;away. The cow easily put to flight the&#xA;soldiers and sought refuge at the feet of&#xA;the sage.&#xA;Moved by the piteous appeal of his&#xA;beloved cow, who was like a younger&#xA;sister to him, the sage said: &amp;ldquo;Bring forth&#xA;soldiers to resist Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s men.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sabala instantaneously did so, and the&#xA;aggressors were soon worsted. Wild with&#xA;rage, Viswamitra got into his chariot and,&#xA;taking up his bow, rained arrows on the&#xA;soldiers brought forth by the cow, but&#xA;their strength was inexhaustible, and the&#xA;royal forces suffered utter defeat. The&#xA;sons of Viswamitra now chose Vasishtha&#xA;himself as their target, only to be reduced&#xA;to ashes.&#xA;Defeated and disgraced, Viswamitra&#xA;then and there entrusted his kingdom to&#xA;one of his sons and proceeded to the&#xA;Himalayas to perform tapas, directing his&#xA;devotions to Lord Siva to gain power with&#xA;which to subdue Vasishtha.&#xA;So firm and steadfast was Viswamitra&#xA;in his austerities that Lord Siva was&#xA;pleased and appeared before him. He&#xA;asked the king what his object was in&#xA;performing tapas.&#xA;Viswamitra replied: &amp;ldquo;If you, Umapati,&#xA;are satisfied with my tapas let me be&#xA;blessed with divine arrows and be master&#xA;of every weapon.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So be it,&amp;rdquo; said Siva, and gave&#xA;Viswamitra all the weapons available to&#xA;the Devas, Gandharvas, Rishis, Yakshas&#xA;and the Demons.&#xA;Swelling with pride like the ocean,&#xA;Viswamitra considered Vasishtha as&#xA;already vanquished. He straightway made&#xA;for the abode of the sage. Frightened at&#xA;the fearful sight of the onrushing&#xA;Viswamitra, Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s disciples and the&#xA;animals in his ashrama ran helter-skelter.&#xA;Hit by the fire-weapon of Viswamitra,&#xA;Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s ashrama was reduced to&#xA;cinders.&#xA;Vasishtha regretted the turn of events,&#xA;but determined to end the haughtiness of&#xA;the erstwhile king, he faced him calmly&#xA;with his Brahmadanda (holy staff) in&#xA;hand.&#xA;Mad with rage, Viswamitra shot at him&#xA;all the divine weapons he had acquired,&#xA;but they were quenched as they&#xA;approached the rishi&amp;rsquo;s staff and were&#xA;absorbed by it.Viswamitra had but one more weapon&#xA;in his armory, and that was the most&#xA;powerful of all, the Brahmastra. As he&#xA;hurled it against Vasishtha the world&#xA;became wrapped in gloom as in some&#xA;huge eclipse, and the very immortals&#xA;trembled with fear. But the terrible astra&#xA;itself was merged in the rishi&amp;rsquo;s staff,&#xA;making both it and the holy man glow&#xA;with the glory they had absorbed.&#xA;Viswamitra stood dazed. Openly&#xA;accepting defeat, he said: &amp;ldquo;Of what use is&#xA;the Kshatriya&amp;rsquo;s might in arms? With but a&#xA;staff in his hand, this Vasishtha has&#xA;nullified all my weapons. Lord Siva has&#xA;indeed fooled me. There is no alternative&#xA;for me but to become a Brahma Rishi like&#xA;Vasishtha.&amp;rdquo; So saying, he withdrew from&#xA;the field of battle and proceeded south for&#xA;more rigorous tapas.&#xA;For years and years Viswamitra went&#xA;through terrible austerities. Pleased with&#xA;his perseverance, Brahma presented&#xA;himself before him. Advising Viswamitra&#xA;that, as a result of his tapas he had risen to&#xA;the position of a rishi among kings,&#xA;Brahma vanished from the scene.&#xA;Viswamitra was disappointed that all&#xA;his penance could get him only the status&#xA;of Raja Rishi. Not content with anything&#xA;but the highest the rank of a Brahma&#xA;Rishi, he subjected him self to still more&#xA;rigorous austerities in order that he might&#xA;be acknowledged an equal of Vasishtha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That was the time when the famous&#xA;king of the Solar dynasty, Trisanku, was&#xA;reigning, who was so much in love with&#xA;the beauty of his body that he could not&#xA;bear the thought of parting with it at death&#xA;and desired to ascend to heaven in that&#xA;very body.&#xA;Vasishtha, his preceptor, whom he&#xA;approached for help in realising his wish,&#xA;advised him to give up attempting the&#xA;impossible. Dissatisfied with Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;response, the King approached the sage&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;sons and sought their help. They were&#xA;wroth at being asked to do something&#xA;which their father had pronounced&#xA;impossible, ridiculed his vanity and curtly&#xA;bade him begone.&#xA;King Trisanku would not give up his&#xA;aim and told them that, since they and&#xA;their father were too poor in merit to help&#xA;him, he would find others who were&#xA;richer. Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s sons were provoked&#xA;beyond endurance, and said: &amp;ldquo;Be you a&#xA;chandala.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The curse began to act and the next&#xA;morning Trisanku woke up a different&#xA;person altogether, an untouchable, ugly of&#xA;form, attired in dirty clothes.&#xA;His ministers and his people could not&#xA;recognise him. Driven out of his kingdom&#xA;he wandered hungry and weary almost to&#xA;death, till his destiny took him to&#xA;Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s ashrama.&#xA;The king&amp;rsquo;s appearance moved the heart&#xA;of the sage, who enquired: &amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you&#xA;King Trisanku? What has brought you to&#xA;this plight? Whose curse?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Recounting all that had happened he&#xA;fell at the sage&amp;rsquo;s feet and said: &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;been a good king and never swerved from&#xA;the path of dharma. I have committed no&#xA;sin and wronged none. My preceptor and&#xA;his sons have deserted me and cursed me&#xA;and you see me thus before you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra took pity on the King&#xA;converted by a curse into a chandala. This&#xA;was Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s great weakness; he was&#xA;impulsive and easily over-powered by&#xA;emotions like anger, sympathy and love.&#xA;In sweet words, he made the king&#xA;happy: &amp;ldquo;O, King, I have heard of your&#xA;righteous rule. I offer you refuge; be not&#xA;afraid. I will arrange for the sacrifice&#xA;which will enable you to enter heaven in&#xA;your own body. And in this very chandala&#xA;form you shall reach heaven despite your&#xA;Guru&amp;rsquo;s curse. Of this you may be sure.&amp;ldquo;And he made arrangements for a great&#xA;and unprecedented yaga.&#xA;Viswamitra directed his disciples to&#xA;invite all the sages and, their disciples for&#xA;the proposed yaga. Afraid of saying &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo;&#xA;to what was more or less a command, all&#xA;the rishis agreed to be present.&#xA;But the sons of Vasishtha declined the&#xA;invitation and made merry about a yaga at&#xA;which the officiating priest was a once&#xA;upon-a-time Kshatriya and the yajaman a&#xA;stinking chandala.&#xA;This reply, duly conveyed, enraged&#xA;Viswamitra who exploded into a curse&#xA;that Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s sons do die and be reborn&#xA;for seven generations in a tribe given to&#xA;eating dog&amp;rsquo;s flesh.&#xA;The sage then began the yaga.&#xA;Extolling Trisanku&amp;rsquo;s eminent virtues,&#xA;Viswamitra sought the help of the other&#xA;rishis in effecting the bodily translation of&#xA;Trisanku to heaven.&#xA;Well aware of the sage&amp;rsquo;s mighty&#xA;powers and fulminous temper, the invitees&#xA;lent their support, and the yaga went on. It&#xA;reached the stage when the gods were&#xA;invoked to descend and accept the&#xA;offerings. But no god came. It was clear&#xA;that Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s yaga was a failure. And&#xA;the rishis, who had attended the&#xA;ceremony, laughed within themselves at&#xA;Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s discomfiture.&#xA;Wild with rage, Viswamitra held the&#xA;ladle of ghee over the flames and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Trisanku, here behold my power. I now&#xA;transfer for your benefit all the merit I&#xA;have earned. If my austerities have any&#xA;value, they should lift you to heaven in&#xA;your physical frame. I care not if the&#xA;Devas reject my offerings. King Trisanku!&#xA;Ascend!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A&#xA;miracle&#xA;followed.&#xA;To&#xA;the&#xA;astonishment&#xA;of&#xA;those&#xA;assembled,&#xA;Trisanku in his chandala body rose&#xA;heavenward. The world saw the power of&#xA;Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s tapas.&#xA;Trisanku reached Swarga. But Indra&#xA;forthwith pushed him down saying, &amp;ldquo;Who&#xA;are you, entering heaven with a chandala&#xA;body? You fool that earned the curse of&#xA;your preceptor, go down again.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Trisanku fell from heaven, head down&#xA;wards, screaming, &amp;ldquo;Viswamitra! Save&#xA;me!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra, seeing this, was beside&#xA;himself with rage. Determined to teach the&#xA;gods a lesson, he shouted to Trisanku.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Stop there! Stop there!&amp;rdquo; and, to the&#xA;amazement of all, Trisanku&amp;rsquo;s earthward&#xA;descent came to an abrupt stop and he&#xA;stopped in mid air, shining like a star.&#xA;Like a second Brahma, Viswamitra&#xA;proceeded to create a new starry horizon&#xA;to the south as well as a new Indra and&#xA;new Devas.&#xA;Alarmed at their supremacy, the Devas&#xA;now came to terms and humbly entreated&#xA;Viswamitra to desist. They said: &amp;ldquo;Let&#xA;Trisanku stay where he is at present. Let&#xA;the other stars, of your creation shine&#xA;forever, like your own fame and honor.&#xA;Control your anger and be friends with&#xA;us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Gratified at this submission, and as&#xA;easily appeased as provoked, Viswamitra&#xA;baited his creative process. But his&#xA;stupendous activities had consumed the&#xA;whole of the power that he had thus far&#xA;acquired by his austerities, and he found&#xA;he had to begin again.&#xA;Viswamitra now proceeded westwards&#xA;to Pushkara and resumed his austerities.&#xA;For years the rigorous tapas continued, but&#xA;once again as it was about to bear fruit&#xA;something happened to rouse his anger&#xA;and he lost his balance and cursed his own&#xA;sons. Soon recovering himself, he firmly&#xA;resolved never again to yield to anger, and&#xA;resumed his tapas&#xA;After many years of austerities,&#xA;Brahma and the Devas appeared before&#xA;him and said: &amp;ldquo;O Kausika! Your tapas hasborne fruit. You are no longer in the ranks&#xA;of kings; you have become a real rishi.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having thus blessed Viswamitra, Brahma&#xA;returned.&#xA;This was again a disappointment. He&#xA;wanted to become a Brahma Rishi and&#xA;Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s peer and he had only been&#xA;acknowedged an ordinary rishi. It was&#xA;recognition as futile as the missiles of&#xA;power, which Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s Brahmadanda&#xA;had swallowed.&#xA;He therefore decided to go on with his&#xA;tapas, making it more severe than ever&#xA;before.&#xA;The Devas did not like this. They sent&#xA;the heavenly damsel Menaka to tempt him&#xA;with her celestial beauty and allurements.&#xA;She went to Pushkara where Viswamitra&#xA;was undergoing austerities and played, to&#xA;catch his eye with a hundred wiles of&#xA;charm and grace. Viswamitra saw her and&#xA;was fascinated by her beauty. His vow&#xA;was broken and he spent ten years in a&#xA;dream of ioy, forgetful of his high resolve.&#xA;Awaking at last, he looked at the&#xA;trembling Menaka sorrow fully and said&#xA;he would not curse her, for it was his own&#xA;folly, and not her fault, as in tempting him&#xA;she was only carrying out the orders of&#xA;her master. And sadly he wended his way&#xA;to the Himalayas to resume his broken&#xA;tapas.&#xA;There, for a thousand years, controlling&#xA;his senses, he performed rigorous tapas.&#xA;At the request of the Devas, Brahma&#xA;appeared before Viswamitra, and spoke to&#xA;him thus sweetly: &amp;quot; I welcome you as a&#xA;Maharishi, my son. Pleased with your&#xA;soulful tapas I confer on you that title and&#xA;the sanctity it imports.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unmoved alike by gratification or&#xA;disappointment, Viswamitra folded his&#xA;hands in adoration and asked the Father of&#xA;the Universe if the boon meant conquest&#xA;over the senses.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;By no means&amp;rdquo;, said the Creator, &amp;ldquo;but&#xA;strive to subjugate the senses, tiger among&#xA;munis!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Resolved on the supreme conquest,&#xA;Viswamitra entered on another thousand&#xA;years of even harder tapas which threw&#xA;the Devas into even greater consternation.&#xA;Indra called unto him the celestial&#xA;damsel Rambha, and enjoined on her as a&#xA;vital service to the Devas, to employ all&#xA;her art to bring Viswamitra under the spell&#xA;of her charm, and divert him from his&#xA;purpose. She was sorely afraid, but Indra&#xA;assured her that she would not be left&#xA;alone, but be accompanied by the God of&#xA;Love and the Spirit of Springtime would&#xA;be with her for support.&#xA;Unwillingly she went and as she&#xA;entered the precincts of the hermitage, the&#xA;forest blossomed into vernal beauty, and&#xA;the south wind blew gently laden with the&#xA;scent of flowers, and kokilas burst into&#xA;song. Love and Spring were both there to&#xA;assist Beauty. Disturbed by stirrings to&#xA;which he had long been a stranger,&#xA;Viswamitra opened his eyes and saw a&#xA;smiling damsel of surpassing beauty, who&#xA;seemed the very soul of the spring with its&#xA;flowers and fragrance and song.&#xA;At this vision of soft voluptuousness a&#xA;white heat of anger surged through him as&#xA;he recognised in it another temptation&#xA;thrown in his way by the envious gods,&#xA;and he cursed the temptress: &amp;ldquo;O Rambha,&#xA;for seeking to tempt me who am striving&#xA;to conquer anger and desire, be thou&#xA;frozen to an image of stone for ten&#xA;thousand years.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But this explosion of rage made him&#xA;see how far he was from the fulfilment of&#xA;his purpose and sadly he quitted the&#xA;Himalayan forests, and sought the solitude&#xA;of the east.&#xA;There, he restrained his breathing, gave&#xA;up all thought of the things of the world,&#xA;and performed austerities so stern thatsmoke and flames issued from his body&#xA;and enveloped the universe. Then at the&#xA;prayer of the panic-stricken gods, Brahma&#xA;again appeared before him, and hailed him&#xA;as Brahma Rishi: &amp;ldquo;All hail, Brahma Rishi,&#xA;I am pleased with you. Blessed be your&#xA;life.&amp;rdquo; Viswamitra was happy.&#xA;But humbly he said: &amp;ldquo;How can I be&#xA;happy unless from Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s lips I hear&#xA;that I am a Brahma Rishi?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vasishtha smiled remembering his&#xA;fight with Viswamitra, and said to him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have achieved the fruit of your great&#xA;austerities. Indeed you are a Brahma&#xA;Rishi, my brother.&amp;rdquo; There was joy all&#xA;round.&#xA;This was the story of the sage that&#xA;arrived suddenly at Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;King, Dasaratha received Viswamitra&#xA;as Indra would welcome Brahma and&#xA;touching his feet, the King said: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;indeed blessed among men. Your coming&#xA;can only be due to the merit of my&#xA;ancestors. Like the morning sun that&#xA;dispels the darkness of night, your face&#xA;brings joy to my sight. My heart is full.&#xA;Born a king, you have become through&#xA;tapas a Brahma Rishi. And you yourself&#xA;have come seeking my dwelling. Is there&#xA;anything in my power that I can do for&#xA;you? If so, command and I shall obey.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra was rejoiced to hear these&#xA;words of Dasaratha, and his face&#xA;brightened. He said: &amp;ldquo;O King, your words&#xA;are worthy of you. Born in the Ikshvaku&#xA;line, with Vasishtha for your Guru, what&#xA;else could you say? You have said &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;&#xA;before I asked. This fills my heart with&#xA;joy.&amp;rdquo; And he straightway explained the&#xA;purpose of his visit.&#xA;Viswamitra said: &amp;ldquo;I am engaged in&#xA;performing a sacrifice. As it nears&#xA;completion, two powerful Rakshasas,&#xA;Maricha and Subahu, defile it. They&#xA;shower unclean blood and flesh on the&#xA;sacred fire. Like other rishis we could&#xA;curse and destroy them. But that would be&#xA;a waste of all our tapas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Our troubles will end if you send with&#xA;me Rama, the eldest of your warlike sons.&#xA;Under my care, he will grow in princely&#xA;stature. He will surely defeat these&#xA;Rakshasas and his name will gather lustre.&#xA;Entrust Rama to my care only for a few&#xA;days. Do not refuse my request. Fulfil the&#xA;promise you gave me unsought. Of&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s safety you need have no anxiety.&#xA;You will earn undying fame in the three&#xA;worlds. Vasishtha and your ministers will&#xA;agree with what I say.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha trembled with fear and&#xA;anxiety. He had a hard choice to make;&#xA;either to give his well-beloved son to be&#xA;killed by the Rakshasas or himself incurs&#xA;the terrible anger of Viswamitra.&#xA;For a few moments, Dasaratha stood&#xA;speechless, for he was stunned and&#xA;bewildered. But recovering from the&#xA;shock, he begged the sage not to press his&#xA;demand, and said: &amp;ldquo;Rama is not yet fully&#xA;sixteen years of age. How can he fight&#xA;with Rakshasas? Of what use is it to send&#xA;him with you? What does he know of the&#xA;wiles of Rakshasas? It is not right that I&#xA;should send a mere lad to fight them, I am&#xA;here, and my army is ready to march.&#xA;How can a lad protect you and your yaga?&#xA;Tell me all about your foes. I shall go with&#xA;you at the head of my army and do your&#xA;bidding and serve your need. Do tell me&#xA;about these desecrators.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra described Maricha and&#xA;Subahu and Ravana their master. And he&#xA;demanded again that Rama should be sent&#xA;along with him.&#xA;Dasaratha persisted in refusal. &amp;ldquo;Parting&#xA;from Rama will be death to me,&amp;rdquo; he said.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I shall go with you, I and my army. Why,&#xA;it seems to me the task proposed is pretty&#xA;hard even for me. How then can my soncope with it? Indeed, I cannot send him. If&#xA;you please, I am ready with my army.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s attempt to go back on his&#xA;hasty word, enraged Viswamitra. The&#xA;King&amp;rsquo;s pleas and reasons were like oil&#xA;poured on the fire of his anger.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This conduct is unworthy of your&#xA;lineage&amp;rdquo;, the sage said. &amp;lsquo;Tell me if this is&#xA;your final word. I shall go back the way I&#xA;came. Long may you live with your kith&#xA;and kin, having swerved from the path of&#xA;Truth!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The earth quaked and the gods were&#xA;afraid of the possible consequences of the&#xA;sage&amp;rsquo;s wrath.&#xA;Vasishtha now turned to the King and&#xA;spoke gently: &amp;ldquo;It ill becomes you, King, to&#xA;refuse having promised once. Born in the&#xA;Ikshvaku line, you cannot do it. Having&#xA;once said, &amp;lsquo;I will do&amp;rsquo;, you have no option&#xA;but to do it. Failing, you will lose the&#xA;merit of all your great gifts and deeds.&#xA;Send Rama with the sage, and send&#xA;Lakshmana too. You need have no fear&#xA;for their safety, When they are protected&#xA;by Viswamitra, no Rakshasa can hurt&#xA;them. As the drink of the gods, shielded&#xA;by the wheel of fire, so will Rama be by&#xA;Viswamitra. You have no idea of&#xA;Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s power; he is tapas in human&#xA;form. Bravest of the brave and wisest of&#xA;the wise, he is master of every weapon. In&#xA;the three worlds there is not, and there&#xA;will never be, any to equal him in martial&#xA;or spiritual prowess. When he was king he&#xA;obtained from the gods mastery of all&#xA;weapons. He beholds the past, the present&#xA;and the future. Then why does he want the&#xA;princes, you may wonder. He can well&#xA;take care himself of his yaga; but it is for&#xA;the good of your sons that he has come&#xA;here and appears to seek your help. Do not&#xA;hesitate. Send your sons with him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to the wise Vasishtha,&#xA;Dasaratha saw things clearly and made up&#xA;his mind to send Rama and Lakshmana.&#xA;The two princes were then brought to&#xA;the presence of the sage. The King, the&#xA;Queen-Mothers and Vasishtha blessed&#xA;them and sent them with Viswamitra.&#xA;A pleasant breeze wafted and flowers&#xA;were strewn by the denizens of the&#xA;heavens. Auspicious sounds were heard.&#xA;Bow in hand, the two lads strode proudly&#xA;on either side of the Sage.&#xA;Valmiki and Kamban revel in this&#xA;picture of the two handsome princes&#xA;marching out to their first adventure under&#xA;the guardianship of a great rishi who had&#xA;also been a renowned warrior a teacher&#xA;who could create a new world; and beside&#xA;him, head erect, two princely pupils born&#xA;to end the Rakshasa race.&#xA;With swords of victory hanging from&#xA;their waists, bows and quivers mounted on&#xA;strong shoulders, they moved, each like a&#xA;three-headed cobra with uplifted hood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Viswamitra and the two princes spent&#xA;the night on the bank of the river Sarayu.&#xA;Before retiring Viswamitra initiated the&#xA;princes in two secret mantras Bala and&#xA;Atibala, which had the virtue of guarding&#xA;them from fatigue and harm. They slept&#xA;on the verdant bank that night and rising&#xA;at dawn proceeded on their journey. They&#xA;reached Kamashrama in Anga Desa. After&#xA;presenting the princes to the rishis there,&#xA;Viswamitra recounted to them the history&#xA;of the ashrama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This,&amp;rdquo; be said, &amp;ldquo;is the place where the&#xA;Lord Siva was long engaged in austerities.&#xA;It was here that the foolish god of love&#xA;Manmatha aimed his arrow at Siva and&#xA;was turned to ashes by his wrath. Hence&#xA;this place is known as Kamashrama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They were the guests of the rishis that&#xA;night, and the following morning, after&#xA;performing the usual rites, the sage and&#xA;his pupils set out on their journey andreached the Ganga. They crossed the river&#xA;on a raft got ready for them by the rishis.&#xA;In midstream, the princes heard a noise&#xA;and asked Viswamitra what it could be.&#xA;He explained to them that it was the sound&#xA;of the Sarayu flowing into the Gangs. The&#xA;princes paid silent homage to the&#xA;confluence of the two holy rivers.&#xA;A river or a hill, a tree or a cloud,&#xA;indeed any object of beauty may raise one&#xA;to contemplation of the Supreme Being&#xA;and silent worship of Him. In particular,&#xA;sacred rivers, temples or images, which&#xA;have for generations been the objects of&#xA;devotion and worship, possess this power&#xA;in a special degree, in virtue of the sacred&#xA;thoughts they have witnessed and&#xA;absorbed as garments retain perfumes.&#xA;Having crossed the Ganga, Viswamitra&#xA;and the princes made their difficult way&#xA;through a dense forest made dreadful by&#xA;the reverberating roar of wild beasts.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This,&amp;rdquo; Viswamitra said, &amp;ldquo;is the&#xA;Dandaka forest. What is now a terrible&#xA;forest was once a well-peopled country.&#xA;Once upon a time, Indra was&#xA;contaminated by sin, having killed Vritra,&#xA;and had therefore to exile himself from&#xA;the world of the Devas. The Devas set to&#xA;themselves the task of cleansing Indra.&#xA;They brought waters from the sacred&#xA;rivers&#xA;and&#xA;bathed&#xA;him&#xA;to&#xA;the&#xA;accompaniment of mantras. The waters&#xA;which cleansed Indra flowed into the&#xA;ground and enriched the earth and the land&#xA;be came tremendously fertile.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All dead things, rotting corpse or&#xA;stinking garbage, when returned to the&#xA;earth are transformed into things of beauty&#xA;such as fruits and flowers and the&#xA;wholesome things that nourish life. Such&#xA;is the alchemy of Mother Earth.&#xA;Viswamitra&#xA;continued:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;For&#xA;long&#xA;people lived here happily till Tataka (wife&#xA;of Sunda, a Yaksha) and her son Maricha&#xA;wrought havoc and changed this into the&#xA;dreadful wilderness it now is. They are&#xA;still in this forest. And none dare enter it&#xA;for fear of Tataka. She is equal in strength&#xA;to a score of elephants. I have brought you&#xA;here to rid the forest of this great enemy.&#xA;There is no doubt that this monster, who is&#xA;a source of trouble to the rishis, will be&#xA;destroyed by you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama, who listened to this, asked the&#xA;sage: &amp;ldquo;You say she is a Yaksha. I have&#xA;never heard that Yakshas are particularly&#xA;strong. What is more, how does a woman&#xA;happen to possess so much strength?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra replied: &amp;ldquo;You are asking a&#xA;very pertinent question. Her strength&#xA;comes from a boon granted by Brahma.&#xA;There lived a Yaksha by name Suketu.&#xA;Having no progeny he performed tapas&#xA;and won a boon from Brahma thus: &amp;lsquo;You&#xA;will have a beautiful daughter of great&#xA;strength of body, but you will have no&#xA;son.&amp;rsquo; Suketu&amp;rsquo;s daughter, Tataka, beautiful&#xA;and strong, was married to Sunda, a&#xA;Yaksha, and their child is Maricha. Sunda&#xA;at one time incurred Sage Agastya&amp;rsquo;s curse&#xA;and died. Provoked by this, Tataka and&#xA;Maricha pounced on Agastya who cursed&#xA;them to be monsters living on the carcases&#xA;of men. So Tataka is now an ugly&#xA;monster. Thenceforward, she and Maricha&#xA;have been harassing the dwellers in this&#xA;region of Agastya. Do not hesitate to&#xA;destroy her on the ground that it is against&#xA;Kshatriya dharma to kill a woman. Her&#xA;atrocities are intolerable. To punish the&#xA;wicked, whether male or female, is the&#xA;duty of kings. It is right to kill her, as to&#xA;kill a wild animal for the sake of human&#xA;safety. This is a duty cast on rulers. Many&#xA;women have been punished with death for&#xA;their crimes. Hence do not hesitate.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama said to Viswamitra: &amp;ldquo;Our father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;behest is that we should obey you without&#xA;question. Bidden by you and for the&#xA;general welfare, we shall kill Tataka.&amp;ldquo;So saying, he strung his bow and&#xA;twanged it till the forest echoed to its&#xA;shrill note and the wild animals scattered&#xA;in all directions in terror. It reached&#xA;Tataka in her fastness, filling her with&#xA;amazement at the audacious intruder who&#xA;dared enter her domain. Raging with&#xA;anger, she ran in the direction whence the&#xA;sound came and sprang on Rama. The&#xA;battle began.&#xA;The prince at first thought of cutting&#xA;off the limbs of the monster and sparing&#xA;her life. But Tataka attacked fiercely and,&#xA;rising in the sky, she rained stones on&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana. The two princes&#xA;defended themselves against the attack.&#xA;The fight continued and Viswamitra&#xA;cautioned Rama against delay in dealing&#xA;the death-blow to the monster.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;She deserves no sympathy,&amp;rdquo; he said.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The sun is about to set and remember&#xA;that at night Rakshasas grow stronger. Do&#xA;not delay to slay her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus advised, Rama decided on killing&#xA;Tataka and pierced her chest with a deadly&#xA;arrow and the huge, ugly monster fell&#xA;down, lifeless.&#xA;The Devas cheered, and Viswamitra,&#xA;filled with joy, embraced Rama and&#xA;blessed him.&#xA;With Tataka&amp;rsquo;s end, the forest was freed&#xA;from the curse and became beautiful to&#xA;see. The princes spent the night there and&#xA;next&#xA;morning&#xA;they&#xA;proceeded&#xA;to&#xA;Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s ashrama.&#xA;At dawn the next day, Viswamitra&#xA;called Rama to his side and blessing him&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;I am very happy indeed. What is it&#xA;that I can do in return for all that you have&#xA;done? I shall teach you the use of all the&#xA;astras.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So&#xA;saying,&#xA;Viswamitra&#xA;gave&#xA;Ramachandra the divine astras which he&#xA;had&#xA;obtained&#xA;through&#xA;his&#xA;tapas.&#xA;Viswamitra taught Rama the use, control&#xA;and recall of the various divine weapons&#xA;and Rama in his turn imparted the&#xA;knowledge to Lakshmana.&#xA;As they continued the journey, Rama&#xA;pointed to a big hill with a lovely forest on&#xA;its slopes and asked: &amp;ldquo;Is that the place&#xA;whereto we have to go? And who are the&#xA;evil ones who hinder your yaga? And&#xA;what should I do to destroy them?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ramachandra was eager to fight and&#xA;win the blessings of the sage.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;That is the place we are going to,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;replied Viswamitra. &amp;ldquo;There the Lord&#xA;Narayana performed tapas and it was&#xA;there that he was born as Vamana. It goes&#xA;by the name of Siddhashrama. Mahabali,&#xA;son of Virochana and grandson of&#xA;Prahlada the good Asura, was such a&#xA;powerful ruler that of him even the Devas&#xA;were afraid. Mahabali had by his deeds&#xA;acquired the power of Indra himself.&#xA;Kashyapa and his spouse Aditi, of whom&#xA;all the gods were offsprings, prayed to&#xA;Vishnu and begged Him to be born as&#xA;their son and protect Indra and the Devas&#xA;from Mahabali. In answer to the prayers,&#xA;Vishnu was born of Aditi as Vamana.&#xA;Vamana in the form of a young student&#xA;went to the yaga that was being performed&#xA;by Mahabali and whereto all were&#xA;welcome, to ask for and receive anything&#xA;they wanted. When Vamana presented&#xA;himself as a suitor, Mahabali&amp;rsquo;s guru,&#xA;Sukra, the preceptor of all the Asuras,&#xA;knew who he really was and warned&#xA;Mahabali against promising to grant the&#xA;young Brahmana his request since indeed&#xA;he was the Lord Hari in disguise, come to&#xA;undo him. Mahabali did not pay heed to&#xA;this. It was his wont never to turn down a&#xA;request. Besides, he was at heart a devotee&#xA;of the Lord, and felt that he would indeed&#xA;be blessed if the Lord should deign to&#xA;accept a gift from him. With a smile,&#xA;Mahabali bade him ask for what he&#xA;pleased without hesitation. &amp;lsquo;All have is at&#xA;your disposal, money, jewels, the wideearth and all it inherits.&amp;rsquo; Vamana answered&#xA;that wealth was of no use to him, and all&#xA;he begged for was three paces of ground,&#xA;as paced by him. The monarch smiled as&#xA;he looked at the diminutive brahmachari&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;legs and said, &amp;lsquo;So be it; pace and take it.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;The little Bachelor suddenly grew in size&#xA;into Trivikrama and with one step&#xA;measured the earth and with another the&#xA;entire heavens. And there being no room&#xA;left for the third step that had been&#xA;granted, he set his foot on Mahabali&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;devoted head. In the eyes of God, the head&#xA;of a bhakta is as wide as the earth or the&#xA;heavens. And Mahabali, whose head was&#xA;blessed by the touch of Narayana&amp;rsquo;s foot,&#xA;became one of the seven immortals of the&#xA;world.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After narrating the story of Mahabali,&#xA;Viswamitra added: &amp;ldquo;This is where at first&#xA;Narayana and later Kashyapa performed&#xA;tapas, resulting in the incarnation of God&#xA;as Vamana. In this holy place I live. And&#xA;here the Rakshasas come and obstruct our&#xA;worship and our austerities. Your coming&#xA;here is to end this evil.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So be it,&amp;rdquo; said Rama.&#xA;The arrival of Viswamitra and the two&#xA;princes was a signal for rejoicing at the&#xA;ashrama. The rishis offered water and&#xA;fruits according to custom. Rama told&#xA;Viswamitra that he might begin the&#xA;preparations for his yaga immediately and&#xA;Viswamitra took the vows that very night.&#xA;Getting up very early the next morning,&#xA;the princes went to Viswamitra and asked&#xA;when the Rakshasas were expected so that&#xA;they might hold themselves in readiness to&#xA;receive them.&#xA;Viswamitra was under a vow of&#xA;silence, and could not answer, but the&#xA;rishis, his jouniors, told the princes that&#xA;they should be ceaselessly vigilant for six&#xA;nights and days to safeguard the sacrifice.&#xA;The princes, fully armed, kept vigil for&#xA;six days and nights. On the morning of the&#xA;sixth day Rama told Lakshmana:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Brother, now is the time for the enemies&#xA;to come. Let us be wary.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even as he was saying this, flames shot&#xA;up from the sacrificial fire, for Agni, the&#xA;God of Fire, knew that the Rakshasas had&#xA;arrived. As the rites were being&#xA;performed, there was heard from the sky a&#xA;great roar.&#xA;Rama looked up and saw Maricha and&#xA;Subahu and their followers preparing to&#xA;shower unclean things on the sacrificial&#xA;fire The army of Rakshasas covered the&#xA;sky like a great black cloud.&#xA;Rama said, &amp;ldquo;Look Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; and let&#xA;go the Manavastra at Maricha. As was&#xA;intended, it did not kill Maricha, but&#xA;wrapping him up in resistless force hurled&#xA;him a full hundred yojanas near the sea.&#xA;With the Agneyastra Rama killed&#xA;Subahu; and then the two princes utterly&#xA;destroyed the entire army of Rakshasas.&#xA;The sky was bright again.&#xA;Viswamitra was supremely happy at&#xA;the completion of his yaga. &amp;ldquo;I am grateful&#xA;to King Dasaratha,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You have&#xA;fulfilled the promise, princes. I admire&#xA;your fortitude. This ashrama has through&#xA;you become again a scene of success,&#xA;Siddhashrama.&amp;rdquo; (Siddha means success).&#xA;The next day, Rama and Lakshmana,&#xA;after their morning prayers, went to&#xA;Viswamitra and asked for further orders.&#xA;The purpose of Rama&amp;rsquo;s birth was not&#xA;unknown to Sage Viswamitra. And he&#xA;knew too the powers of the weapons he&#xA;had given to Rama. Still the actual fact&#xA;when experienced is something more than&#xA;expectation. Sage Viswamitra was happy&#xA;beyond words, and his face glowed like a&#xA;flame. He then thought of the service that&#xA;he still had to do for Rama. This was the&#xA;prince&amp;rsquo;s marriage with Sita.&#xA;The rishis assembled there said to&#xA;Rama: &amp;ldquo;We intend proceeding to the&#xA;kingdom of Videha, where in the capitalcity of Mithila, Janaka, the illustrious&#xA;philosopher king, intends to perform a&#xA;great sacrifice. All of us are going there&#xA;and it will be good if you and the prince,&#xA;your brother, accompany us. It is meet and&#xA;proper that the Prince of Ayodhya should&#xA;see the marvellous bow in the court of&#xA;Janaka.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So it was decided, and Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana went with Viswamitra to&#xA;Janaka&amp;rsquo;s city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Janaka, king of Mithila, was an ideal&#xA;ruler. He was a much revered friend of&#xA;Dasaratha who, when he planned his yaga&#xA;for progeny, sent not mere messengers but&#xA;ministers to Mithila to invite King Janaka.&#xA;Janaka was not only a brave king but&#xA;was as well-versed in the Sastras and&#xA;Vedas as any rishi and was the beloved&#xA;pupil of Yajnavalkya whose exposition of&#xA;Brahmana to him is the substance of the&#xA;Brihadaranyaka&#xA;Upanishad.&#xA;In&#xA;the&#xA;Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna cites Janaka&#xA;as an illustrious example of the Karma&#xA;yogin. Janaka was thus worthy to be the&#xA;father of Sita who was to be the wife of&#xA;Vishnu come down on Earth in human&#xA;form.&#xA;Desirous of performing a yaga, Janaka&#xA;at one time ploughed the chosen site. As&#xA;usual, this was done by his own hand.&#xA;As the field was being cleared and&#xA;leveled, Janaka saw among shrubs a baby&#xA;divinely beautiful. Janaka was childless&#xA;and accepted the infant as the goddess&#xA;Earth&amp;rsquo;s gift to him.&#xA;Taking the child in his arms he went to&#xA;his beloved wife and said: &amp;ldquo;Here is&#xA;treasure for us. I found this child on the&#xA;yaga site and we shall make it our own.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And she joyfully consented.&#xA;The beauty of the goddess Earth mortal&#xA;eyes cannot see in its fulness, but we get&#xA;glimpses of it as we gaze with grateful&#xA;hearts on the emerald green or golden&#xA;ripeness of spring time or autumn fields,&#xA;or with awe and adoration on the glories&#xA;of mountain and valley, rivers and ocean.&#xA;This loveliness was Sita in its entirety.&#xA;Kamban would have it that Sita&amp;rsquo;s beauty&#xA;threw into the shade Lakshmi herself who&#xA;came up with Nectar as the Ocean of Milk&#xA;was being churned. This child of divine&#xA;beauty was brought up by King Janaka&#xA;and his dear queen.&#xA;When Sita reached the age of marriage&#xA;Janaka was sad that he would have to part&#xA;with her. Though he tried hard, he was for&#xA;long unable to choose a prince worthy of&#xA;Sita. Many kings came to Mithila, seeking&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s hand, but in Janaka&amp;rsquo;s view none of&#xA;them was good enough. The King&#xA;anxiously thought over the matter and&#xA;came to a decision. Long ago, pleased&#xA;with a yaga performed by Janaka, Varuna,&#xA;presented to him Rudra&amp;rsquo;s bow and two&#xA;quivers. That was an ancient heavenly&#xA;bow, which no ordinary man could even&#xA;move.&#xA;This was kept by him as an honored&#xA;heirloom. Since only a very exceptional&#xA;man could be considered worthy of Sita,&#xA;Janaka issued this proclamation: &amp;ldquo;Sita, my&#xA;daughter, will be given in marriage to the&#xA;prince who can lift, bend and string the&#xA;bow of Siva which Varuna gave me and to&#xA;none other.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Many princes who had heard of Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;beauty, went to Mithila only to return&#xA;disappointed. None could fulfil the&#xA;condition.&#xA;Led by Viswamitra, the rishis from&#xA;Siddhashrama were proceeding to Mithila,&#xA;with&#xA;bullock-carts transporting their&#xA;luggage. The animals and the birds in the&#xA;ashrama set out to follow Viswamitra, but&#xA;he gently bade them stay behind.&#xA;It was evening when they reached the&#xA;river Sona. There they rested for the night,&#xA;Viswamitra recounting to Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana the history of the place.Getting up in the morning, they continued&#xA;their journey and crossed another river,&#xA;not very deep, and by noon they were at&#xA;the Ganga.&#xA;They bathed in the holy river and the&#xA;rishis made lustrations to their forbears.&#xA;They improvised an ashrama there,&#xA;performed their pujas and cooked their&#xA;food. Meal over, they sat round&#xA;Viswamitra who, at the request of the two&#xA;princes, told the story of the Ganga.&#xA;Himavan, king of mountains and his&#xA;spouse, Menaka, had two daughters of&#xA;whom Ganga was the elder. Himavan sent&#xA;her to the land of the Devas in response to&#xA;their request and she dwelt with them.&#xA;Uma, the younger, won the favor of Siva&#xA;and became his spouse.&#xA;Sagara, a former King of Ayodhya, had&#xA;no son for a long time. With his two&#xA;wives, Kesini and Sumati, he went to&#xA;Himalaya and performed tapas. Sage&#xA;Bhrigu, pleased with the king, blessed him&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;You will get a number of&#xA;children and will acquire undying fame.&#xA;One of your wives will give birth to an&#xA;only son, and through him your lineage&#xA;will be continued. The other queen will&#xA;bear sixty thousand strong-armed sons.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sagara&amp;rsquo;s wives bowed low before the&#xA;sage and asked which one of them would&#xA;get an only son and which the sixty&#xA;thousand children. Sage Bhrigu asked&#xA;each of them their own desire.&#xA;Kesini said she would be satisfied with&#xA;one son who would continue the line;&#xA;Sumati chose the other alternative. &amp;ldquo;Be it&#xA;so,&amp;rdquo; said the sage.&#xA;Satisfied, the king and his wives took&#xA;leave of the sage and returned to&#xA;Ayodhya. In course of time, Asamanjas&#xA;was born to Kesini; Sumati gave birth to a&#xA;fissiparous mass which divided out into&#xA;sixty thousand babies. This army of&#xA;children was wen taken care of by nurses.&#xA;Years rolled by; and while the sixty&#xA;thousand grew into strong, handsome&#xA;princes, Asamanjas turned out to be a&#xA;cruel lunatic. He indulged in the pastime&#xA;of throwing little children into the river&#xA;and laughed merrily as they struggled and&#xA;died.&#xA;Naturally people hated this maniac and&#xA;banished him from the country. To the&#xA;great relief of all, Asamanjas&amp;rsquo; son,&#xA;Amsuman, was the opposite of his father&#xA;and was a brave, virtuous and amiable&#xA;prince.&#xA;King Sagara launched a great horse-&#xA;sacrifice and prince Amsuman was in&#xA;charge of the sacrificial horse, but Indra,&#xA;in the guise of a Rakshasa, managed to&#xA;carry off the animal. The Devas regarded&#xA;yagas by mortals as a challenge to their&#xA;superiority, and lost no opportunity of&#xA;throwing obstacles in their way. If,&#xA;however, all obstruction was overcome&#xA;and the yaga was completed, they&#xA;accepted offerings made to them. And&#xA;then he who performed the yaga got due&#xA;reward.&#xA;The king was greatly upset when he&#xA;heard that the sacrificial horse was stolen.&#xA;He sent out the sixty thousand sons of&#xA;Sumati to go in search of the animal all&#xA;over the earth and to spare no pains to&#xA;retrieve it.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The loss of the horse,&amp;rdquo; he impressed&#xA;on them, &amp;ldquo;not only means obstruction to&#xA;the yaga; it casts sin and ignominy on an&#xA;concerned. You should, therefore, recover&#xA;the horse, wherever it may be kept&#xA;hidden.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Eagerly the sons of Sagara proceeded&#xA;to search the entire earth, but the horse&#xA;was nowhere to be found. They even&#xA;started digging the earth as for buried&#xA;treasure, and in their anxiety respected&#xA;neither place nor person and only&#xA;succeeded in earning the hatred of all they&#xA;met. The horse was not to be found; andwhen they reported their failure to the&#xA;King, he bade them ransack the nether&#xA;world also. The princes did as they were&#xA;told and in Patala they saw the horse&#xA;grazing in a corner of an ashrama, not far&#xA;from the place where Sage Kapila who&#xA;was Vishnu sat in meditation.&#xA;The princes at once jumped to the&#xA;conclusion that they had not only found&#xA;the stolen horse but the thief also, and&#xA;they rushed on Kapila shouting, &amp;ldquo;Here is&#xA;the thief pretending to be a yogi.&amp;rdquo; Kapila&#xA;thus disturbed opened his eyes and the&#xA;sixty thousand princes were reduced to a&#xA;heap of ashes. Indra, the real thief, had&#xA;artfully left the horse here with this very&#xA;intent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KING Sagara waited in vain for the&#xA;return of the princes who had gone in&#xA;search of the sacrificial horse.&#xA;After some days he called his&#xA;grandson, Amsuman, and said: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;anxious to know what has happened to the&#xA;princes who went to Patala. You are&#xA;brave; go thither, well-armed and find out&#xA;what has happened and come back&#xA;crowned with success.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Amsuman went closely following the&#xA;path of the princes and reached the nether&#xA;world where he saw and paid salutations&#xA;to the mighty elephants standing guard at&#xA;the four quarters. These guardians of the&#xA;quarters uttered encouraging words and&#xA;said he would succeed in his mission.&#xA;When in due course Amsuman entered&#xA;and went round Patala he was delighted&#xA;when he found the sacrificial horse&#xA;grazing contentedly there, but was&#xA;perplexed and distressed when he saw&#xA;heaps of ashes all over the place. Could&#xA;they be all that remained of his valiant&#xA;uncles?&#xA;Garuda, the bird-king, brother of&#xA;Sumati, Sagara&amp;rsquo;s second wife, who&#xA;chanced to be there told Amsuman:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Those ash heaps are all that is left of the&#xA;sixty thousand sons of Sagara who were&#xA;consumed by the wrathful glance of Sage&#xA;Kapila. Dear child, take the horse and&#xA;complete the yaga. If these ashes are to be&#xA;watered according to custom so that the&#xA;souls of the princes may rest in peace,&#xA;Ganga should be brought down here from&#xA;the land of the Devas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Amsuman rushed home with the horse&#xA;and told the king all that he had found and&#xA;learnt.&#xA;Sagara was immersed in sorrow at the&#xA;fate that had overtaken his sons. However,&#xA;the horse having been brought back, he&#xA;completed the yaga. Grieving over his lost&#xA;sons and despairing of ever bringing&#xA;Ganga down to the nether world, he died&#xA;disconsolate.&#xA;According to the Ramayana, Sagara&#xA;lived for 30,000 years. Figures like 30,000&#xA;and 60,000 need not confuse us. Thirty&#xA;thousand may mean either a very large&#xA;number or just thirty. If we so like, we&#xA;may take these figures literally.&#xA;Amsuman succeeded Sagara as King of&#xA;Ayodhya and was, in turn, succeeded by&#xA;Dilipa. Bhagiratha came after Dilipa.&#xA;Amsuman and Dilipa though happy&#xA;and blessed in other respects, died&#xA;grieving that they were unable to bring&#xA;Ganga to Patala for the salvation of their&#xA;forefathers.&#xA;Bhagiratha was a valiant king. He was&#xA;childless. Desiring progeny and hoping to&#xA;bring Ganga down, he left for Gokarna for&#xA;performing penance, leaving the kingdom&#xA;in the hands of his ministers.&#xA;Bhagiratha&#xA;went&#xA;through&#xA;severe&#xA;austerities. With fire on all sides and head&#xA;exposed to the hot sun, and taking food&#xA;but once a month, he continued his tapas.&#xA;Bhagiratha&amp;rsquo;s name has come to signify&#xA;great perseverance in any good cause.Brahma, pleased with the tapas,&#xA;appeared before Bhagiratha and asked:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What would you have?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhagiratha told him two wishes: &amp;ldquo;If&#xA;you have pity on me, bless me with a&#xA;child to continue the line of my forebears.&#xA;Secondly, cursed by Kapila Muni, my&#xA;ancestors lie a heap of ashes in Patala. The&#xA;ashes should be washed by the waters of&#xA;Ganga so that their souls may ascend top&#xA;heaven. May you be pleased to order&#xA;Ganga to go down.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Brahma replied: &amp;ldquo;The Devas are&#xA;pleased with your tapas. You wishes are&#xA;granted. But there is one difficulty. The&#xA;earth cannot withstand the force of&#xA;Ganga&amp;rsquo;s descent. Siva alone can stand it.&#xA;Therefore direct your penance and prayers&#xA;to him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bhagiratha renewed his tapas and&#xA;continued long without food or water, and&#xA;at last won Siva&amp;rsquo;s grace. Siva appeared&#xA;and said to Bhagiratha: &amp;ldquo;I shall fulfil your&#xA;wish. I shall receive Ganga on my head.&#xA;May her grace be upon you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Mahadeva promised help to&#xA;Bhagiratha, Ganga began her descent as&#xA;ordered by Brahma. In her arrogance, she&#xA;thought she would fall on Mahadeva&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;head and sweep him away towards Patala.&#xA;The three-eyed God decided to teach&#xA;Ganga a lesson. And the moment he&#xA;willed it, the flood of waters that fell on&#xA;his head were held by his matted hair as in&#xA;an infinite receptacle. Ganga tried her best&#xA;but not a drop could emerge from the&#xA;tangled maze of Siva&amp;rsquo;s matted locks.&#xA;This was a lesson to Ganga to be sure,&#xA;but a heart-braking disappointment to&#xA;Bhagiratha. There was nothing for him but&#xA;to propitiate Siva with tapas. This he did&#xA;to such good purpose that Siva took pity&#xA;on him and gently let out the waters of&#xA;Ganga in Bindu Saras from where they&#xA;flowed down in seven small separate&#xA;streams.&#xA;Three of them flowed west and three&#xA;east; and the seventh river followed&#xA;Bhagiratha who was full of joy at the&#xA;approaching salvation of his ancestors.&#xA;Ganga followed Bhagiratha&amp;rsquo;s triumphal&#xA;chariot; the waters danced and shone like&#xA;lightning flashes as the river made its&#xA;course and the Devas and Gandharvas&#xA;assembled above to witness the grand&#xA;sight. Sometimes slow and sometimes&#xA;fast, now sliding down and now jumping&#xA;up, the river went on dancing behind&#xA;Bhagiratha&amp;rsquo;s chariot and the folk of&#xA;heaven enjoyed the sight all the way.&#xA;On her course, Ganga damaged the&#xA;yaga platform of a rishi by name Jahnu.&#xA;The rishi took the entire flood in his palm&#xA;and sipped it off. Ganga disappeared again&#xA;and Bhagiratha was sorely perplexed.&#xA;The Devas and other rishis approached&#xA;Jahnu and begged him to forgive Ganga&#xA;and allow Bhagiratha to reap the fruit of&#xA;his great austerities and perseverance. The&#xA;sage relented and let Ganga out through&#xA;his right ear. The Devas were glad and&#xA;blessed Ganga thus: &amp;ldquo;Coming out of the&#xA;rishi&amp;rsquo;s body as out of your mother&amp;rsquo;s womb,&#xA;you are now Jahnavi, Jahnu&amp;rsquo;s daughter.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There was no further hindrance or&#xA;mishap and Ganga reached Patala through&#xA;the ocean. With the holy waters,&#xA;Bhagiratha performed the funeral rites for&#xA;his arcestors and secured for them their&#xA;entry to heaven.&#xA;Bhagiratha&amp;rsquo;s efforts having brought&#xA;Ganga down, she is known as Bhagirathi.&#xA;After&#xA;concluding&#xA;this&#xA;narrative,&#xA;Viswamitra blessed the princes. &amp;ldquo;The sun&#xA;is setting,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Let us say our&#xA;evening prayers in the waters of Ganga&#xA;whom your ancestor brought down to this&#xA;world.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Those who bathe in the holy waters of&#xA;Ganga or read or listen to this divine story&#xA;with devotion, will be cleansed of sin andendowed with&#xA;unflagging zeal,&#xA;virtue,&#xA;and strength.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a day&amp;rsquo;s stay in the City of Visala,&#xA;Viswamitra and his party left for Mithila.&#xA;On the way, not far from Mithila, they&#xA;saw a beautiful ashrama which seemed&#xA;untenanted. Rama asked Viswamitra:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Whose is this ashrama with ancient&#xA;trees? Why does such a beautiful abode&#xA;stand deserted?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This ashrama is subject to a curse.&#xA;Sage Gautama lived here with his wife&#xA;Ahalya, spending his days in peace and&#xA;holy meditation. One day during the sage&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;absence from the ashrama, Indra, filled&#xA;with unholy desire for the beautiful&#xA;Ahalya, entered it disguised as Gautama&#xA;and approached the lady with urgent&#xA;solicitation. She was not deceived by the&#xA;impersonation, but vain of her beauty and&#xA;proud that it had won her the love of the&#xA;lord of the celestials, she lost her&#xA;judgment and yielded to his desire. When&#xA;the sin had been sinned, realising its&#xA;heinousness and the fierce spiritual energy&#xA;of her betrayed husband, she warned Indra&#xA;of his terrible peril and begged him to be&#xA;gone in the instant. Indra was fleeing in&#xA;guilty panic; but unfortunately for him he&#xA;almost bumped into the rishi who was just&#xA;returning from his ablutions, clad in wet&#xA;garments and radiating spiritual lustre.&#xA;Pretence was hopeless before that all-&#xA;seeing wisdom and Indra bowed in abject&#xA;supplication, and threw himself on the&#xA;mercy of the rishi. The sage looked at him&#xA;with wrath and loathing and cursed him:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Lustful beast as you are, dead to all truth&#xA;and righteousness, may your manhood fall&#xA;away from you.&amp;rsquo; Indra at once became an&#xA;eunuch and went back to the Devas in&#xA;ignominious shame. Then the sage turned&#xA;to his erring wife and prescribed a long&#xA;penance for her. He said: &amp;lsquo;Living on air,&#xA;you shall stay here, unseen by anyone.&#xA;After a long time, Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s son will&#xA;pass this way. When he sets foot in this&#xA;ashrama, you will be freed from the curse.&#xA;Welcome him as a guest. You will then&#xA;recover your lost virtue and get back your&#xA;own beauty.&amp;rsquo; The sage then left his&#xA;violated ashrama for Himalayas to engage&#xA;himself in austerities there.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra said to Rama: &amp;ldquo;Let us enter&#xA;the ashrama. You will bring redemption to&#xA;Ahalya and rekindle the light in her as the&#xA;sage promised.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And they went into the ashrama. As&#xA;Rama set foot in the ashrama, the curse&#xA;was lifted and Ahalya stood before them&#xA;in all her beauty. Having lain concealed&#xA;behind leaves and creepers and kept her&#xA;vow for many years, she now shone, says&#xA;the poet, in Rama&amp;rsquo;s presence, like the&#xA;moon emerging from the clouds, like a&#xA;flame issuing from smoke and like the&#xA;sun&amp;rsquo;s reflection in rippling water.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana touched the feet&#xA;of the sage&amp;rsquo;s wife made pure by penance.&#xA;She welcomed the divine princes with all&#xA;the customary rites of hospitality. A&#xA;shower of flowers descended from the&#xA;heavens as Ahalya, cleansed of sin, shone&#xA;like a goddess. Simultaneously the sage&#xA;Gautama returned to the ashrama and&#xA;received his repentant and purified wife&#xA;back to his affection.&#xA;That is Ahalya&amp;rsquo;s story as told by&#xA;Valmiki. There are in other Puranas and&#xA;popular stories slightly varying versions,&#xA;but the differences need not trouble us.&#xA;Now, a word to those of our times who&#xA;read Ramayana and Bharata and other&#xA;Puranas. In these works, there are frequent&#xA;references to Devas and Rakshasas. The&#xA;latter were wicked, had no regard for&#xA;dharma, and reveled in evil deeds. Asuras&#xA;were also like Rakshasas. But even among&#xA;Rakshasas there were a few wise and&#xA;virtuous people. There spring up bad meneven in the best of races and vice versa.&#xA;On the whole, Asuras and Rakshasas were&#xA;those who rejoiced in doing wicked deeds.&#xA;It is a pity that some people in their&#xA;ignorance identify the Asuras and&#xA;Rakshasas with ancient Indian tribes and&#xA;races, a view not supported by any literary&#xA;work or tradition or recorded history.&#xA;The conjecture of foreigners that the&#xA;Rakshasas were the Dravidian race, is not&#xA;borne out by any authority in Tamil or&#xA;other literature. The Tamil people are not&#xA;descendants of the Asuras or Rakshasas.&#xA;The Devas were generally upholders of&#xA;dharma and took on themselves the task of&#xA;putting down the Rakshasas. According to&#xA;the Puranas, they had at times to deviate&#xA;from dharma in dealing with the&#xA;Rakshasas, some of whom had attained&#xA;great power through tapas.&#xA;The Devas were generally good; and&#xA;those among them who swerved from the&#xA;path of righteousness paid the price for it.&#xA;There was no separate code of conduct for&#xA;the Devas; the law of Karma admits of no&#xA;distinction between the Devas and others.&#xA;The law dealt with the Devas as with&#xA;others.&#xA;Wedded to virtue as the Devas&#xA;generally were, lapses on their part appear&#xA;big to us, like stains on white cloth. The&#xA;Rakshasas&amp;rsquo; evil deeds are taken for&#xA;granted and do not attract much attention,&#xA;like stains on black cloth.&#xA;The honest, when they happen to go&#xA;astray, should evoke our sympathy. It is&#xA;however the way of the world, but it is not&#xA;right, to condemn in strong terms casual&#xA;lapses of the virtuous, while tolerating&#xA;habitual wrong-doers.&#xA;It should be noted that in the Puranas&#xA;we see the gods getting entangled in&#xA;dilemmas of Dharma. Indra and other&#xA;Devas are shown often as committing&#xA;serious sins.&#xA;Why did the sages who told the&#xA;Puranas involve themselves in such&#xA;difficulties? Their aim was to awaken&#xA;people to a sense of the dangers of&#xA;adharma. Else, the sages need not have&#xA;deliberately attributed sinful acts to their&#xA;own heroes and created difficulties for&#xA;themselves.&#xA;Some persons take pleasure in jumping&#xA;to wrong conclusions from the incidents&#xA;in the Puranas. They argue: &amp;ldquo;Ravana was&#xA;a very good king. Valmiki has falsely&#xA;accused him of wicked deeds.&amp;rdquo; They ask:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Did not Rama act unjustly on a certain&#xA;occasion? Did not Sita utter a lie?&amp;rdquo; and the&#xA;like. Valmiki could well have omitted&#xA;incidents which are not edifying. Both&#xA;Rama and Ravana were first presented to&#xA;us by the poet Valmiki.&#xA;There was no earlier work referring to&#xA;Ravana that can be quoted to contradict&#xA;Valmiki and stamp him as being partial to&#xA;Rama, Sita and the Devas, and twisting&#xA;facts to deceive people. Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;Ramayana is the fountain source of the&#xA;story of Rama; in it, one comes across&#xA;seemingly wrong deeds.&#xA;Calm consideration of such situations&#xA;would show that they are just portrayals of&#xA;similar difficulties in our day-to-day life.&#xA;It is for us to benefit from the moral trials&#xA;contained in them. The lesson of the&#xA;Ahalya episode is that, however deadly&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s sin, one may hope to be freed from&#xA;its consequence by penitence and&#xA;punishment. Instead of condemning others&#xA;for their sins, we should look within our&#xA;own hearts and try to purify them of every&#xA;evil thought. The best of us have need for&#xA;eternal vigilance, if we would escape sin.&#xA;This is the moral of Ahalya&amp;rsquo;s error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All arrangements for Janaka&amp;rsquo;s yaga had&#xA;been completed and to Mithila had come&#xA;many rishis and Brahman&amp;rsquo;s from various&#xA;kingdoms. Viswamitra and the princeswere duly welcomed. Janaka&amp;rsquo;s preceptor,&#xA;Satananda, was the first to pay honor to&#xA;Viswamitra. Janaka followed him.&#xA;The King said to the sage: &amp;ldquo;I am indeed&#xA;blessed that you should attend my yaga.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Pointing to Rama and Lakshmana,&#xA;Janaka asked Viswamitra: &amp;ldquo;Who are these&#xA;god-like youths who resemble each other,&#xA;and carry their weapons with the proud&#xA;ease of seasoned warriors? Who is the&#xA;happy father of such sons?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra told Janaka that they were&#xA;the sons of King Dasaratha. He narrated&#xA;how they had protected his own yaga and&#xA;destroyed the Rakshasas. &amp;ldquo;They have&#xA;come here,&amp;rdquo; the sage went on, &amp;ldquo;to see, if&#xA;they may, the great bow of Rudra in your&#xA;palace.&amp;rdquo; Janaka understood the meaning&#xA;of Viswamitra&amp;rsquo;s words and rejoiced.&#xA;The King said: &amp;ldquo;The prince is welcome&#xA;to see the bow. If he can string it, he will&#xA;win the hand of my daughter. Many were&#xA;the princes who saw this bow and went&#xA;back, unable even to move it. I shall&#xA;indeed be happy if this prince succeeds&#xA;where so many have failed and I am&#xA;thereby enabled to give Sita to him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Janaka then ordered his men to bring&#xA;the bow which was kept safe and sacred in&#xA;an iron box. It was brought on an eight-&#xA;wheeled carriage and dragged like a&#xA;temple chariot during a festival.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here,&amp;rdquo; said Janaka, &amp;ldquo;is Rudra&amp;rsquo;s bow&#xA;worshipped by me and my ancestors. Let&#xA;Rama see this bow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After&#xA;obtaining&#xA;permission&#xA;from&#xA;Viswamitra and the King, Rama stepped&#xA;out to the iron bow-case, while all eyes&#xA;were fixed on him in wishful expectation.&#xA;Opening the box, he lifted the bow&#xA;effortlessly, as if it were a garland of&#xA;flowers, and resting one end of it against&#xA;his toe, he bent and strung it and drew the&#xA;string back with such irresistible force that&#xA;the mighty bow snapped with a crash like&#xA;a clap of thunder. And there fell from&#xA;heaven a shower of flowers.&#xA;Janaka proclaimed: &amp;ldquo;My beloved&#xA;daughter shall be wedded to this prince.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viswamitra said to Janaka: &amp;ldquo;Send your&#xA;swiftest messengers to Ayodhya to give&#xA;the news to Dasaratha and invite him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Janaka&amp;rsquo;s messengers reached Ayodhya&#xA;in three days. They met King Dasaratha&#xA;who was seated, like Indra, on his throne&#xA;and said to him: &amp;ldquo;Sage Viswamitra and&#xA;King Janaka have sent you happy news.&#xA;Your son who came to Mithila has won&#xA;our princess Sita by fulfilling the&#xA;condition set for her hand. He not only&#xA;strung Rudra&amp;rsquo;s bow which none before&#xA;could so much as lift, but bent its tough&#xA;pride till it broke. King Janaka eagerly&#xA;awaits your gracious consent for the&#xA;marriage, and your presence and blessing&#xA;at the festivities. May it please you to start&#xA;for Mithila with your retinue.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha, who had sent Rama with&#xA;Viswamitra with a heart not altogether&#xA;free from anxiety even after the sage&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;assurance, was thrilled with joy on&#xA;hearing this good news. He told his&#xA;ministers to prepare for the journey and&#xA;left the very next day for Janaka&amp;rsquo;s capital.&#xA;Dasaratha and his following reached&#xA;Mithila&#xA;and&#xA;were&#xA;received&#xA;with&#xA;enthusiastic&#xA;welcome.&#xA;Exchange&#xA;of&#xA;courtesies over, Janaka said to Dasaratha:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My yaga will soon be over. I think it best&#xA;to have the marriage as soon as the yaga is&#xA;over,&amp;rdquo; and sought his approval.&#xA;Dasaratha replied: &amp;ldquo;You are the bride&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;father and it is for you to order things as&#xA;you wish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At the appointed day and hour, giving&#xA;away the bride, King Janaka said to&#xA;Rama: &amp;ldquo;Here is my daughter, Sita, who&#xA;will ever tread with you the path of&#xA;dharma. Take her hand in yours. Blessed&#xA;and devoted, she will ever walk with you&#xA;like your own shadow.&amp;ldquo;Iyam Sita mama suta&#xA;sahadharmacharee tava&#xA;prateechchha chainam bhadram&#xA;te&#xA;panim grihneeshwa panina&#xA;pativrata mahabhaga&#xA;chhayevanugata sada.&#xA;This sloka is uttered in every wedding&#xA;in upper India when the bride is given&#xA;away.&#xA;Thus was Sita given by Janaka to&#xA;Rama. Were they not Eternal Lovers&#xA;reunited? And so they rejoiced like lovers&#xA;come together after separation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 PARASURAMA&#39;S DISCOMFITURE</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/rAmAyaNam/kAvyam/bhAShAntaram/en/rAjagopAlAchAri/10_PARASURAMAS_DISCOMFITURE/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having thus safely handed back to&#xA;Dasaratha at Mithila the princes entrusted&#xA;to him in Ayodhya, and after attending the&#xA;wedding celebrations, Viswamitra took&#xA;leave of the two kings and went to&#xA;Himalaya. In the story of Rama,&#xA;Viswamitra has no further part.&#xA;Viswamitra may be said to be the&#xA;foundation of the grand temple of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;story. After Rama&amp;rsquo;s wedding in Mithila,&#xA;we do not see him again. It should be&#xA;noted that characters that play a leading&#xA;role in one canto of Valmiki almost fade&#xA;out in subsequent cantos. Viswamitra who&#xA;dominates the Bala Kanda does not appear&#xA;again. Similarly, Kaikeyi and Guha are&#xA;prominent only in Ayodhya Kanda. The&#xA;same thing can be said of Bharata whom&#xA;we do not come across in the chapters&#xA;intervening&#xA;between&#xA;the&#xA;Chitrakuta&#xA;meeting and Rama&amp;rsquo;s return to Ayodhya.&#xA;The poet hardly brings Bharata before&#xA;our eyes during the period of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;distress. The characters in Valmiki&#xA;Ramayana&#xA;(unlike&#xA;those&#xA;in&#xA;the&#xA;Mahabharata and in ordinary plays and&#xA;novels) do not present themselves off and&#xA;on. Critics should bear this general&#xA;characteristic of Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s epic in mind.&#xA;King Dasaratha returned to Ayodhya,&#xA;accompanied by his retinue. On the way,&#xA;there were bad omens and anxious&#xA;Dasaratha asked Vasishtha what they&#xA;portended. Vasishtha replied that there&#xA;was no need to be alarmed, for though the&#xA;birds in the air indicated approaching&#xA;trouble, the animals on the land promised&#xA;a happy consummation.&#xA;As Dasaratha and Vasishtha were thus&#xA;conversing, there broke out a great storm.&#xA;Trees were uprooted; the earth quaked and&#xA;clouds of dust went up and hid the sun and&#xA;there was an all-enveloping darkness.&#xA;Everyone was terror-struck. Soon they&#xA;knew the reason for the strange&#xA;phenomenon. There stood before them the&#xA;awe-inspiring figure Parasurama, the&#xA;sworn enemy of Kshatriyas, with a bow&#xA;on one shoulder and a battle-axe on the&#xA;other, and with an arrow shining like&#xA;lightning in his hand.&#xA;Terrible in appearance, with his matted&#xA;locks gathered overhead, he looked like&#xA;Rudra exulting in the destruction of&#xA;Tripura. His face emitted flame-like&#xA;radiance. The son of Sage Jamadagni&#xA;struck terror among Kshatriyas, many&#xA;generations of which he had annihilated.&#xA;Wherever he went he was preceded by&#xA;storm and earthquake. And the Kshatriya&#xA;race trembled in fear.&#xA;The Brahmanas in Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s retinue&#xA;said to one another: &amp;ldquo;Because his father&#xA;was killed by a king, Parasurama took a&#xA;vow to destroy the Kshatriya race. We&#xA;dared to hope that his vengeful wrath had&#xA;been quenched in the blood of the&#xA;innumerable kings he has slain. Has he&#xA;again started his cruel campaign?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;However, they honored him with the&#xA;customary offering of water.&#xA;After&#xA;receiving&#xA;it,&#xA;Parasurama&#xA;addressed himself to Rama: &amp;ldquo;Son of&#xA;Dasaratha, I have heard of your prowess. I&#xA;was somewhat surprised to learn that youstrung the bow in King Janaka&amp;rsquo;s court and&#xA;that you drew the string till the bow broke.&#xA;Here is my bow, equal in all respects to&#xA;the one that you broke. This is the bow of&#xA;Vishnu which was entrusted to my father.&#xA;If you are able to string this bow, you will&#xA;be worthy of my battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha was perturbed at this turn of&#xA;events and he begged that his son Rama&#xA;should be spared the trial. He said to&#xA;Parasurama: &amp;ldquo;You are a Brahmana. We&#xA;have heard that, satiated with your&#xA;revenge, you have gone back to tapas as&#xA;becomes your order, in pursuance of your&#xA;plighted word to Indra, after giving away&#xA;the earth you had conquered to Kashyapa.&#xA;Is it proper that you should break your&#xA;vow, and seek to injure a prince of tender&#xA;years who has done you no wrong, and&#xA;who is dearer to us than life?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Parasurama&#xA;heard&#xA;him&#xA;unmoved&#xA;without so much as looking at him, and&#xA;addressed himself solely to Rama, as&#xA;though the others did not exist:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Viswakarma originally made two exactly&#xA;similar bows. One of them was given to&#xA;Rudra and the other to Vishnu. This is the&#xA;one given to Vishnu. What you are said to&#xA;have strung and bent to the breaking point&#xA;was Siva&amp;rsquo;s bow. See if you can, string this&#xA;bow of Vishnu; and if you do, it will be&#xA;proof of your skill and strength and I will&#xA;then honor you by fighting with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Parasurama spoke in a loud and&#xA;arrogant tone. To him Rama replied in&#xA;courteous manner, yet in firm tones: &amp;ldquo;Son&#xA;of Jamadagni! You have been vengeful&#xA;because your father was killed by a king. I&#xA;do not blame you for that. But you cannot&#xA;put me down as you have humbled others.&#xA;Please give me your bow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying, he took the bow and arrow&#xA;from Parasurama. He strung the bow and&#xA;setting the arrow to it, drew the string.&#xA;Addressing Parasurama, he said with a&#xA;smile: &amp;ldquo;This mighty Vaishnava arrow&#xA;placed on the string cannot be put back&#xA;idly. It must destroy something. Tell me,&#xA;shall it destroy your powers of&#xA;locomotion, or would you rather that it&#xA;consumes the fruits of your tapas?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As the son of Dasaratha strung the bow&#xA;of Vishnu, the glory on Parasurama&amp;rsquo;s face&#xA;faded, and he stood, no longer the warlike&#xA;conqueror, but a self-subdued rishi, for the&#xA;purpose of the Parasurama avatar was&#xA;over.&#xA;Parasurama said mildly to the Prince of&#xA;Ayodhya: &amp;ldquo;I realise who you are. I am not&#xA;sorry that you have quenched my&#xA;arrogance. Let all my tapas go to you. But&#xA;because of my promise to Kashyapa, I&#xA;cannot remain in his domains and have&#xA;therefore to hurry back to the Mahendra&#xA;Mountains before the sunsets. Let me use&#xA;my power of locomotion for this single&#xA;thing. Subject to this, let the arrow which&#xA;you have set to the bow consume all my&#xA;power earned through tapas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying, Parasurama went in reverent&#xA;circumambulation around the prince and&#xA;departed. Ayodhya&amp;rsquo;s citizens were over-&#xA;joyed to bear that Dasaratha and the royal&#xA;princes were returning to the capital. The&#xA;city was festive with flowers and shone&#xA;like the deva-loka.&#xA;Rama and Sita lived happily in&#xA;Ayodhya for twelve years. Rama had&#xA;surrendered his heart to Sita. It was&#xA;difficult for one to say whether their love&#xA;grew because of their virtues or it was&#xA;planted in their beauty of form. Their&#xA;hearts communed even without speech.&#xA;Sita, rejoicing in Rama&amp;rsquo;s love, shone like&#xA;Lakshmi in heaven.&#xA;Long afterwards, when their forest-life&#xA;began, Anasuya, the great sage Atri&amp;rsquo;s holy&#xA;wife, extolled Sita&amp;rsquo;s love for Rama.&#xA;And Sita answered: &amp;ldquo;How else could it&#xA;be? Rama is a perfect being. His love for&#xA;me equals mine for him. His affection isunchanging. Pure of heart, he has&#xA;mastered the senses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAMA and Sita spent twelve happy&#xA;years in Ayodhya. But now the Lord and&#xA;his consort in human form had to&#xA;experience the hardships, sorrows and&#xA;conflicts of life on earth.&#xA;As&#xA;Bhagavan&#xA;himself&#xA;explains:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Whatever avatar I assume, my play must&#xA;go through the feelings and experiences&#xA;appropriate to that incarnation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Who was the Prince of Ayodhya who&#xA;through his body, life and experience,&#xA;suffered the sorrows of mankind and&#xA;saved the gods? The ever-present, all-&#xA;pervasive Being who rules the world from&#xA;within and without.&#xA;Kamban, the Tamil poet, begins the&#xA;Ayodhya Kanda referring to this marvel&#xA;of how the King of Kings allowed himself&#xA;to suffer the cruel machinations of the&#xA;hunchback maid-servant and of a step-&#xA;mother which deprived him of the sceptre&#xA;and banished birn to the forest and beyond&#xA;the sea.&#xA;Dasaratha loved all his, four sons and&#xA;yet he had a special affection for Rama.&#xA;And the latter deserved it by his royal&#xA;qualities and adherence to dharma. Queen&#xA;Kausalya, like Aditi, the mother of the&#xA;gods, was proud that she had such a son as&#xA;Rama. Valmiki has filled pages with the&#xA;tale of Rama&amp;rsquo;s virtues. The muni is never&#xA;satiated drinking from the ocean of&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s qualities. He describes Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;gifts and graces sometimes directly,&#xA;sometimes as seen and admired by others.&#xA;Thus and in many other ways he dwells&#xA;on the qualities that made Rama the ideal&#xA;man.&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s graceful frame and virile&#xA;beauty, his strength, his courage, the&#xA;purity of his heart, his perfect life, his&#xA;compassion, sweetness of speech, his&#xA;serenity, his deep wisdom and his states&#xA;manship were admired by the people and&#xA;made them eagerly look forward to his&#xA;becoming king.&#xA;And Dasaratha knew and rejoiced in&#xA;this expectation. Hence, considering his&#xA;old age, he wished to crown Rama as&#xA;Yuvaraja and entrust him with the de facto&#xA;rule of the kingdom. Informing his&#xA;ministers of his desire, he had the Raja&#xA;Sabha convened. Rishis and wise men,&#xA;leaders of the city and kings from&#xA;neighboring lands, attended the Raja&#xA;Sabha. When all were seated, each in his&#xA;appropriate place, Dasaratha rose and&#xA;addressed them.&#xA;His deep manly voice, like the sound of&#xA;a trumpet or the roar of rain-bearing&#xA;clouds, filled the great hall. A royal&#xA;radiance shone from his face. His words&#xA;were full of meaning and charmed all&#xA;ears.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Like my ancestors, I have tended this&#xA;kingdom as a mother cares for her child. I&#xA;have worked unremittingly for the people,&#xA;Now my body is old and infirm. I wish&#xA;therefore to appoint my eldest son as&#xA;Yuvaraja and transfer to him the burden of&#xA;responsibility. Following the holy custom&#xA;of my forefathers, I hope to spend the rest&#xA;of my life in austerities in the forest.&#xA;Rama is fully equal to the task of&#xA;kingship. He is expert in administration&#xA;and statecraft and he is unequalled in&#xA;valor. I can transfer this trust of&#xA;sovereignty to him without any anxiety&#xA;and I hope that this honored assembly will&#xA;permit me to do so.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Shouts of joyous acclaim rose from the&#xA;great assembly and with one voice the&#xA;gathered princes and potables exclaimed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So be it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King spoke again: &amp;ldquo;You agree&#xA;with my proposal but give no reason. This&#xA;will not do. Let the wise men explain why&#xA;they agree.&amp;ldquo;Then several speakers rose and&#xA;explained Rama&amp;rsquo;s virtues and fitness to&#xA;rule. The King&amp;rsquo;s heart was filled with joy&#xA;to hear these praises of Rama.&#xA;At last the whole assembly rose and&#xA;said with one voice: &amp;ldquo;Let there be no&#xA;delay. Let Rama be anointed Yuvaraja.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King answered that he was happy&#xA;and would forthwith carry out their&#xA;wishes. Then turning to Vasishtha,&#xA;Vamadeva and the other holy men and&#xA;guardians of the sacred rites, he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This is the auspicious month of Chaitra,&#xA;the season when the trees in the forest are&#xA;covered with flowers. Revered elders,&#xA;make all preparations for the anointing of&#xA;Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The assembly was glad to hear these&#xA;prompt orders. As bidden by the King,&#xA;Sumantra, the minister in charge of the&#xA;household, went to fetch Rama. Rama,&#xA;ignorant of all these happenings, came and&#xA;stood before his father.&#xA;Hearing of the decision to anoint him&#xA;Yuvaraja, he humbly bowed acceptance,&#xA;saying, &amp;ldquo;I am in duty bound to carry out&#xA;your orders, whatever they be.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha blessed Rama and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are a good prince beloved of the&#xA;people. Let not your courtesy and your&#xA;consideration flag but increase with your&#xA;opportunities of doing good, and earn you&#xA;enduring glory.&amp;rdquo; And Rama returned to&#xA;his dwelling.&#xA;Hardly had Rama returned home when&#xA;Sumantra called in haste and told him that&#xA;his father wished to see him. Asked for&#xA;the reason, Sumantra could not tell; he&#xA;only knew he had been enjoined to fetch&#xA;the prince at once.&#xA;Rama thought: &amp;ldquo;The King must have&#xA;taken counsel over the coronation&#xA;ceremony and perhaps met with some&#xA;difficulty. But whatever happens is for the&#xA;best.&amp;rdquo; Rama was not eager to assume&#xA;authority, but looked on it as only a duty&#xA;to be done. If the King wanted him to take&#xA;it up, he was ready to do so. But if the&#xA;King wanted him to give it up, he was&#xA;equally willing. In this mood, Rama went&#xA;to his father&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE King embraced Rama, seated him&#xA;beside him on the throne and said: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;old. I have enjoyed my life as a man and a&#xA;king. I have discharged all my duties to&#xA;my ancestors. There is nothing left for me&#xA;to do. My only desire is to install you on&#xA;the throne of our fathers. Last night I had&#xA;bad dreams. Those who read, the future&#xA;advise me that a great sorrow, even death,&#xA;may overtake me very soon. Hence I wish&#xA;to have the coronation performed&#xA;tomorrow. Tomorrow, the readers of the&#xA;stars say, is auspicious. Something within&#xA;me says, &amp;lsquo;Do this at once.&amp;rsquo; You and Sita&#xA;should prepare for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s anointment&#xA;by fasting tonight. Lie down on a bed of&#xA;darbha grass and have trusty and vigilant&#xA;friends to look after your safety. It seems&#xA;to me that the present time when Bharata&#xA;is away is particularly opportune for your&#xA;installation. Not that I do not know that&#xA;Bharata is the soul of righteousness in&#xA;thought and conduct alike, and that he is&#xA;devoted to you, but the minds of men are&#xA;changeful and open to unexpected&#xA;influences.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so the King decided that the&#xA;coronation should be performed on the&#xA;very next day and told Vasishtha of his&#xA;decision. Bad dreams added to the reasons&#xA;for fixing the day for the coronation at&#xA;once.&#xA;Taking leave of his father, Rama went&#xA;to Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s apartment to give her the&#xA;news and seek her blessing. But the&#xA;Queen had heard the news already.&#xA;Sumitra, Sita and Lakshmana were all&#xA;there with Kausalya, who, clad inceremonial white, sat offering prayers for&#xA;her son.&#xA;Rama reported to his mother the King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;latest command. She answered: &amp;ldquo;This I&#xA;have heard. May you live long. Be a good&#xA;ruler. Conquer your foes and protect your&#xA;subjects and kinsfolk. You have pleased&#xA;your father and you have made me&#xA;happy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then bidding farewell to his mother&#xA;and step-mother, Rama went to his own&#xA;apartment. As directed by the King,&#xA;Vasishtha came to Rama&amp;rsquo;s place. He was&#xA;welcomed by him at the entrance,&#xA;Vasishtha initiated Rama with due&#xA;mantras in his pre-coronation fast.&#xA;As Vasishtha returned to the King, he&#xA;saw groups of people on the royal road,&#xA;cheerfully discussing the great festival of&#xA;the morrow. Houses were being decorated&#xA;with flowers, festoons and flags. It was&#xA;with difficulty that Vasishtha could make&#xA;his way through the crowds to the King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;palace. The King was pleased to hear that&#xA;the fast had begun duly and all was being&#xA;got ready for the ceremony.&#xA;But in his heart of hearts there was a&#xA;fear that some mishap might come&#xA;between him and his one wish.&#xA;The city was in a joyous commotion of&#xA;expectancy. In every house, in every&#xA;street, men, women and children looked&#xA;on the coronation as a great and&#xA;auspicious occasion in their own lives and&#xA;awaited it with enthusiasm.&#xA;Rama and Sita in their dwelling&#xA;meditated long on Narayana, fed with&#xA;ghee the sacrificial fire, and reverently&#xA;sipped what remained of the ghee, and&#xA;slept on grass spread on the floor. Early&#xA;the following morning, they were roused&#xA;from slumber by music and held&#xA;themselves in readiness to proceed to the&#xA;palace and in expectation of the&#xA;auspicious call.&#xA;But the summons that came was of an&#xA;entirely opposite nature.&#xA;In accordance with the practice in royal&#xA;households, Queen Kaikeyi had a woman&#xA;companion and confidential servant. She&#xA;was a hunchback named Manthara. Being&#xA;a distant relation of the Queen, she&#xA;claimed great intimacy with her.&#xA;Manthara is one of the best known&#xA;characters in the Ramayana. Every man,&#xA;woman and child in our land knows and&#xA;detests her, as the cause of Rama&amp;rsquo;s exile,&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s death and all the sorrows&#xA;which befell the royal family.&#xA;On the day on which Dasaratha&#xA;summoned the Assembly and decided to&#xA;anoint Rama as Yuvaraja, Manthara&#xA;happened to climb up to the terrace of the&#xA;women&amp;rsquo;s apartments and stood surveying&#xA;the town below. She saw the streets were&#xA;sprinkled with water and gaily decorated.&#xA;Flags flew from the house-tops. Wearing&#xA;new clothes and bright jewels, smeared&#xA;with sandal paste and decked in flowers,&#xA;people moved about in crowds, engrossed&#xA;in happy talk.&#xA;Musical instruments played in the&#xA;temples. Manthara could not understand&#xA;the reason for all this, for she did not&#xA;know what the King had decided. Some&#xA;celebration was on, she guessed. Manthara&#xA;turned to a servant and asked her: &amp;ldquo;Why&#xA;are you wearing this silk dress? What is&#xA;on in the City? Kausalya seems to be&#xA;distributing gifts to Brahmanas. She is a&#xA;thrifty lady and would not be doing this&#xA;for nothing. There are festive sights and&#xA;sounds everywhere. Do you know what all&#xA;this is about?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The little servant girl answered,&#xA;dancing with joy: &amp;ldquo;Why, do you not know&#xA;that our Ramachandra is going to be&#xA;anointed Yuvaraja tomorrow morning?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This was news! Manthara was&#xA;overpowered with sudden anger. Quickly&#xA;she hobbled downstairs. Straight sheentered Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s room. Kaikeyi was&#xA;resting on her bed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rise, rise, foolish woman! A flood of&#xA;misfortune is rising to drown and swallow&#xA;you! You are betrayed and ruined. Your&#xA;star is setting. Foolish girl, is this the time&#xA;to sleep?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi, fearing that some calamity&#xA;had overtaken Manthara, asked her gently:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is troubling you? Why are you thus&#xA;upset?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And the clever Manthara began:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Destruction has come upon both you and&#xA;me, my girl. Dasaratha has decided to&#xA;make Rama Yuvaraja, the real ruler of this&#xA;land. What greater cause for sorrow need I&#xA;have? When grief comes to you, how can&#xA;I remain unconcerned? I have come&#xA;running to you. You were born and bred&#xA;in a royal family. You were married into a&#xA;royal family. Now, alas, all is over. Like&#xA;the simple woman you are, you have been&#xA;deceived. Your husband has cheated you&#xA;with sweet words. It is a deep plot, as any&#xA;one can see. He put Bharata out of the&#xA;way by sending him to the distant place of&#xA;his uncle, and is taking advantage of his&#xA;absence by hurriedly crowning Rama. By&#xA;tomorrow it will all be over. And you&#xA;watch all this, lying in bed and doing&#xA;nothing, while you and all who depend on&#xA;you are being destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so, Manthara went on talking.&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s ears heard the words without&#xA;quite heeding their drift. Like the rest of&#xA;the royal household her mind was&#xA;overwhelmed now with the joyous&#xA;expectation of Rama&amp;rsquo;s coronation, for she&#xA;loved and esteemed Rama like everybody&#xA;else.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Manthara, you have brought me good&#xA;news,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Is my son Rama to be&#xA;crowned tomorrow? What greater joy can&#xA;come to me? Here, take this. Ask me for&#xA;anything else.&amp;rdquo; So saying, Kaikeyi took&#xA;the necklace off her neck and gave it to&#xA;Manthara. It was a royal custom at once to&#xA;reward with a rich gift the bringer of any&#xA;important good news.&#xA;Kaikeyi thought Manthara, like any&#xA;other officious personal attendant, was&#xA;ingratiatingly jealous in her mistress&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;interests. How could this woman&#xA;understand the goodness of Rama, or&#xA;affairs of State? And so she thought her&#xA;foolish fears would be banished if she saw&#xA;that her mistress was happy at the event.&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s mind was still uncorrupted. She&#xA;had the culture of her noble lineage and&#xA;was not easily amenable to low thoughts.&#xA;This but increased Manthara&amp;rsquo;s grief.&#xA;She flung away the necklace and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Woe to you, stupid woman. All is lost&#xA;and stupidly you laugh with joy. How can&#xA;you be blind to the misfortune that is&#xA;coming to you? Am I to laugh or cry at&#xA;this folly? Your rival, Rama&amp;rsquo;s mother, has&#xA;conspired to making him King. And you&#xA;jump with joy. Insane woman! What&#xA;would be Bharata&amp;rsquo;s state when Rama&#xA;reigns? Would not Rama fear and ever&#xA;look upon Bharata as a dangerous enemy?&#xA;Rama knows human nature. He knows&#xA;that Bharata alive would be a constant&#xA;threat to his power and therefore must be&#xA;killed. Does not one kill a cobra out of&#xA;fear? Hereafter there is no security for&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;life.&#xA;Tomorrow&#xA;morning&#xA;Kausalya will be a happy woman and you&#xA;will bend before her as a well-dressed&#xA;slave. You will stand before her, hands&#xA;clasped in obedience. From tomorrow&#xA;your son too will be a subject and a slave.&#xA;In these apartments there will be no more&#xA;honor or joy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And she stopped, unable for grief to&#xA;continue. Kaikeyi heard all this and&#xA;wondered &amp;ldquo;Why should Manthara have&#xA;such fears? Does she not know Rama? Is&#xA;he not dharma embodied in human form?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;Manthara, have you not&#xA;known&#xA;and&#xA;rejoiced&#xA;in&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;struthfulness, right conduct and humility?&#xA;He is the elder prince and he gets the&#xA;kingdom. Bharata will get it one day after&#xA;him. What is wrong with all this? Why,&#xA;dear friend, do you feel such grief? After&#xA;Rama, Bharata will reign for a hundred&#xA;years. Do not cry. You know how&#xA;affectionate Rama is to me. Indeed he&#xA;cares for me more than for his own&#xA;mother. Does not Rama hold his brothers&#xA;as dear as life? It is not right that you&#xA;should fear any harm from Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas, Alas!&amp;rdquo; said Manthara. &amp;ldquo;Why are&#xA;you so foolish? Once Rama is crowned&#xA;king, what chance has Bharata? Do you&#xA;not know the rule of succession? When&#xA;Rama ascends the throne all prospects of&#xA;royalty for Bharata and his line are at an&#xA;end. After Rama, Rama&amp;rsquo;s son will be king,&#xA;and after him that son&amp;rsquo;s son will be king,&#xA;and so the succession will go on. Eldest&#xA;son succeeds eldest son. There is no&#xA;chance for a younger brother, no matter&#xA;how good or manly he is. My dear, you&#xA;know not even this. What is one to do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Once Rama is crowned,&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;continued, &amp;ldquo;he will not leave Bharata&#xA;alone. There will be danger to Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;life. If you want Bharata to live, advise&#xA;him to remain away, an exile from home;&#xA;for if he returns he will be coming to his&#xA;death. It would be safest for him to leave&#xA;even his uncle&amp;rsquo;s house, and hide his head&#xA;in obscurity in some more distant land.&#xA;And Kausalya is no friend of yours. She&#xA;bears you a grudge because you are the&#xA;King&amp;rsquo;s favorite and have often slighted&#xA;her. And now she is sure to wreak&#xA;vengeance on you. You know the wrath of&#xA;a rival wife is a raging fire when it finds&#xA;its chance. You may take it that, if Rama&#xA;is king, Bharata is as good as dead.&#xA;Therefore, think hard. Be firm. Decide&#xA;something and stick to it. Somehow&#xA;Bharata must be crowned. Rama must be&#xA;banished from the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fear now entered the heart of the&#xA;Queen. Manthara won. Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s face was&#xA;flushed; her breath became hot. Helpless&#xA;she clung to Manthara for comfort and&#xA;safety.&#xA;Because his first two wives had borne&#xA;no children, Dasaratha, following the&#xA;royal custom, married Kaikeyi. At that&#xA;time Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s father secured from&#xA;Dasaratha the promise that the child of her&#xA;womb should become king after him. In&#xA;such a promise given by a childless king&#xA;there was nothing surprising and nothing&#xA;wrong. At that time, his then queens had&#xA;long been childless. The King took a third&#xA;wife for the sake of progeny. Even then&#xA;his wish for a son to be born was not&#xA;fulfilled. Many years passed.&#xA;After&#xA;the&#xA;great&#xA;sacrifice&#xA;was&#xA;performed, all three wives bore children.&#xA;The son of the Queen Eminent, Rama,&#xA;was the eldest among four sons. He was&#xA;also great in virtue, fully equal to the&#xA;burden of Kingship, acceptable to&#xA;ministers, citizens and vassal princes.&#xA;How could Dasaratha violate the royal&#xA;custom and ignoring Rama&amp;rsquo;s claim anoint&#xA;Bharata?&#xA;Moreover, neither Bharata nor Kaikeyi&#xA;had ever thought of or wished for the&#xA;fulfilment of this old and forgotten&#xA;promise. During all the intervening years,&#xA;no word had been spoken on this subject.&#xA;Hence the King thought there could be no&#xA;difficulty in installing Rama as Yuvaraja&#xA;in accordance with the custom of the&#xA;dynasty and public expectation. And there&#xA;was no cloud in Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s mind. This is&#xA;clear from Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s behavior. And&#xA;Bharata was too noble to raise this&#xA;question.&#xA;And, yet, as Dasaratha told Rama, even&#xA;the purest of minds is mutable. When fate&#xA;conspires with bad counsel, any one of us&#xA;might be corrupted. And this happened to&#xA;Kaikeyi. The gods in Heaven had receivedan assurance, and the sages had performed&#xA;tapas or the destruction of Ravana. What&#xA;we call destiny, therefore, ordained that&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s pure heart should be changed by&#xA;Manthara&amp;rsquo;s evil counsel. So says Kamban&#xA;in the Tamil Ramayana in his own&#xA;inimitable style.&#xA;Fearing that delay might bring some&#xA;unpredictable obstacles, Dasaratha had&#xA;ordered the coronation to be done without&#xA;waiting for Bharata&amp;rsquo;s return to the capital.&#xA;This same fear and hurry were used by&#xA;Manthara to persuade Kaikeyi to take the&#xA;wrong path. &amp;ldquo;Think, my Queen. Why this&#xA;haste? Why does your husband rush&#xA;through the ceremony when your son is&#xA;absent? Is it not to cheat him of his right?&#xA;Is not the motive plain? The King&#xA;pretends to be enamored of you. But this&#xA;is only his hypocritical shrewdness.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus tempted, Kaikeyi thought over&#xA;Manthara&amp;rsquo;s advice. Kaikeyi was weak like&#xA;any other woman. She had good feeling&#xA;and good culture, besides a keen intellect.&#xA;But she had little knowledge of the world.&#xA;She was also terribly obstinate. Easily&#xA;deceived, she did not have the power to&#xA;foresee the full consequences of her&#xA;action. Thus began the charter of grief in&#xA;the Ramayana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kaikeyi, who had looked upon Rama&#xA;as her own son, was enmeshed in&#xA;Manthara&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arguments&#xA;and&#xA;became&#xA;helpless.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Indeed, I am afraid,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Tell&#xA;me what we should do. Am I to be a&#xA;servant to Kausalya? Never, Bharata must&#xA;be crowned. You are quite right. And&#xA;Rama must be sent to forest. But how&#xA;shall we get all this done? Tell me. You&#xA;are clever and know the way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And she clung to Manthara. In&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s eyes at that time Manthara&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;crooked frame appeared handsome. This&#xA;is not a joke; it is a subtle psychological&#xA;phenomenon,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This is indeed strange, Kaikeyi,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Manthara. &amp;ldquo;Is it for me to tell you how&#xA;this could be brought about? Have you&#xA;really forgotten? Or, are you only&#xA;pretending? But if you want me to say it, I&#xA;shall do so. Listen.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And then she paused. Kaikeyi, all&#xA;impatient, cried: &amp;ldquo;Tell me, tell me.&#xA;Somehow Bharata must be crowned and&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s coronation must be stopped.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Very well,&amp;rdquo; said Manthara, &amp;ldquo;I shall tell&#xA;you. Do not be impatient. You remember&#xA;how your husband Dasaratha, long ago,&#xA;fought against Sambara in the South? And&#xA;you were with him, were you not? Your&#xA;husband went, did be not, to help Indra?&#xA;Sambara of Vaijayanti was too powerful&#xA;for Indra, who sought Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s help.&#xA;Did not Dasaratha get wounded in battle&#xA;and lose consciousness? Then, you drove&#xA;his chariot skilfully out of the battlefield,&#xA;gently removed the arrows from his body&#xA;and revived him and saved his life. Have&#xA;you forgotten all this? And what did be&#xA;tell you then? He told you in gratitude:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Ask me for two boons. I shall give you&#xA;anything you want.&amp;rsquo; Then you answered: &amp;lsquo;I&#xA;shall ask for my boons later. I want&#xA;nothing now.&amp;rsquo; Then he promised, did he&#xA;not, &amp;lsquo;You will have your two gifts&#xA;whenever you want them&amp;rsquo;? You told me&#xA;all this long ago yourself. You may have&#xA;forgotten it, but I have not. The time has&#xA;arrived to get him to redeem his promise.&#xA;Demand that he should crown Bharata&#xA;instead of Rama. This will be the first of&#xA;two gifts he promised. For the second gift,&#xA;ask that Rama be sent to the forest for&#xA;fourteen years. Do not be frightened. Do&#xA;not fear to ask. Do not think it sinful to&#xA;demand this. Do what I tell you. It is only&#xA;if Rama is sent into the forest that his hold&#xA;on the people will relax and disappear in&#xA;course of time and your son&amp;rsquo;s position willbe secure. Go now and lie down in the&#xA;sulking room. Throw away your fine dress&#xA;and your jewels, wear an old sari and&#xA;stretch yourself on the floor. When the&#xA;King enters the room, do not speak to&#xA;him. Do not even look at him. I am sure&#xA;he cannot endure your sorrow. You will&#xA;then have your way with him. The King&#xA;will try to get round you. Do not yield. He&#xA;will offer many alternatives. Accept none&#xA;of them. Insist on the two boons. Be firm.&#xA;Bound by his promise the King will&#xA;finally come round. I know how&#xA;passionately he loves you. He would give&#xA;up his life for your sake. To please you he&#xA;would jump into fire. Do what I tell you.&#xA;Do not be afraid. Unless Rama is sent to&#xA;the forest, your wish will not be fulfilled.&#xA;Rama must be sent away. Only then the&#xA;position you get for Bharata will be real&#xA;and lasting. Remember this and mind you&#xA;do not weaken.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to this exhortation, Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;face shone with hope. &amp;ldquo;What a brain you&#xA;have, Manthara,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Kaikeyi.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have been the saving of me.&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;she jumped about in joy like a filly.&#xA;Manthara repeated again and again that&#xA;Rama must be sent to the forest. &amp;ldquo;Do not&#xA;delay. What needs to be done, do at once.&#xA;It is no good strengthening the tank-bund&#xA;after the waters have flown out.&#xA;Remember what I have told you.&#xA;Everything depends on your firmness.&#xA;Victory is yours if you do not yield.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi assured Manthara of her&#xA;firmness and forthwith entered the sulking&#xA;room, removed her jewels and scattered&#xA;them on he floor, changed her clothes and&#xA;stretched herself on the floor. Then,&#xA;assuming a broken voice, she said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Manthara, you will yourself carry the&#xA;news to my father Kekaya. You will&#xA;yourself tell him one of two things: either&#xA;that Bharata is to be crowned or that&#xA;Kaikeyi is dead. My dear, dear&#xA;Manthara!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi in her anger believed that&#xA;Dasaratha had really been treacherous to&#xA;her. Even then, stretched on the ground&#xA;divesting herself of all ornaments and&#xA;putting on a face of grief and anger, she&#xA;looked inexpressibly beautiful. So great&#xA;was her beauty.&#xA;The sinful thought had found lodgment&#xA;in her mind and her whole nature was&#xA;transformed. The fear that she would lead&#xA;a slave&amp;rsquo;s life, and that even Bharata&amp;rsquo;s life&#xA;was in peril, had got hold of her. For the&#xA;first time in her life she cast aside the&#xA;sense of shame and sin and hardened her&#xA;heart. Heaving heavy sighs, perspiring,&#xA;and with eyes closed, Kaikeyi, beautiful&#xA;like a Naga goddess, unbraided her hair&#xA;and lay on the floor with dishevelled&#xA;tresses and sprawling like a bird shot&#xA;down by a hunter. The flowers and&#xA;shining jewels, which once adorned her&#xA;person, lay scattered in the dark room like&#xA;stars in the midnight sky.&#xA;Having dismissed the Assembly and&#xA;given orders for the due celebration of the&#xA;coronation ceremony, Dasaratha, relieved&#xA;of care and wishing to relax, sought the&#xA;apartments of his favorite consort. He had&#xA;decided on the coronation of Rama after&#xA;receiving the approval of all those who&#xA;had a right to be consulted and he felt&#xA;happy and free, as after laying down a&#xA;heavy burden.&#xA;He entered Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s chamber to tell&#xA;her the happy news and spend in pleasant&#xA;talk the night before the coronation. The&#xA;junior queen&amp;rsquo;s residence was a beautiful&#xA;palace with lovely gardens and tanks,&#xA;birds playing in the water and peacocks&#xA;dancing with tails spread out and trees&#xA;resplendent with bright flowers. In&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s happy mood it appeared&#xA;unusually beautiful that night.Like the full moon rising brightly&#xA;before an eclipse, without knowing of the&#xA;eclipse that lies in wait for her, the poor&#xA;old King entered Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s dwelling with&#xA;a beaming face. The incense pots and&#xA;drinks were in their usual places but he&#xA;did not see the Queen whom he was eager&#xA;to meet.&#xA;Of all his consorts Kaikeyi was the one&#xA;whose company he sought for joyous&#xA;relaxation from all cares of state, for she&#xA;never interfered in public affairs, and&#xA;always waited for him at the entrance and&#xA;welcomed him with a warm embrace. But,&#xA;today, she was nowhere to be found.&#xA;The King was perplexed. He went&#xA;around and looked in vain for her in all&#xA;her favorite haunts thinking that she was&#xA;playing a sweet game of hide and seeks.&#xA;He did not find her. This sort of thing had&#xA;never happened before! He asked a&#xA;maidservant where the Queen was.&#xA;Folding her hands in reverence, the girl&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Lord, the Queen is angry. She is in&#xA;the inner chamber.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The surprised King entered the room.&#xA;And he saw a sight which amazed and&#xA;distressed him, for there she lay on the&#xA;bare floor, with draggled robes and&#xA;disheveled hair, like one in mortal pain.&#xA;She seemed too full of anguish even to&#xA;look at him as he entered.&#xA;The&#xA;poor&#xA;guileless&#xA;King,&#xA;all&#xA;unconscious of having given any cause for&#xA;offence, behaved with the doting fondness&#xA;of an old husband and seating himself by&#xA;her on the floor stroked her hair and&#xA;strove to console her with loving words&#xA;and caresses:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What has come over you? Are you ill?&#xA;Do you feel any pain? Have I not the best&#xA;doctors in the land? I shall send for them&#xA;at once. They can cure any malady. Do&#xA;not be afraid.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi sighed heavily, but would not&#xA;speak.&#xA;The King proceeded: &amp;ldquo;Was anyone in&#xA;the palace guilty of discourteous&#xA;behavior? Tell me and I shall punish him.&#xA;Did anyone slight you or was there&#xA;anything you wanted which I neglected to&#xA;give you? Tell me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In this way, he mentioned faults that&#xA;might have occurred in the running of a&#xA;big house and asked her what the matter&#xA;was and why she was upset. Kaikeyi paid&#xA;no attention to his questions and was mute&#xA;like one possessed.&#xA;The&#xA;King&#xA;begged&#xA;her&#xA;more&#xA;importunately: &amp;ldquo;State your wish. It shall&#xA;be done. Do you want anyone punished? I&#xA;shall punish him. Do you want anyone&#xA;freed from punishment? I shall free him,&#xA;even if he be a murderer. You know my&#xA;absolute authority, I can give and I can&#xA;take, as I please. Anything, to anyone, I&#xA;can do what I wish. Ask me anything and&#xA;it shall be done at once.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi sat up. The King was pleased.&#xA;And she began: &amp;ldquo;No one slighted or&#xA;dishonored me. But there is something&#xA;which you can do and you must do it for&#xA;my sake. Give me your word that you will&#xA;fulfil my desire. Then I shall tell you what&#xA;it is.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing this, the unsuspecting old man&#xA;was filled with joy. Possessing absolute&#xA;powers, he had no doubt that he could&#xA;fulfil her wishes whatever they were, and&#xA;so boldly and joyously he said: &amp;ldquo;Well,&#xA;Kaikeyi, tell me your wish. It shall be&#xA;done. I swear it. I swear it on all I love&#xA;most on you, the dearest among women,&#xA;and on Rama, dearest to me among men! I&#xA;swear in the name of Rama: Whatever you&#xA;desire, I shall do, I promise, I swear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Guileful&#xA;wickedness&#xA;and&#xA;trustful&#xA;misfortune were reaching the climax in&#xA;their unequal encounter. The King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;swearing in the name of Rama filled&#xA;Kaikeyi with supreme delight. She was&#xA;now sure that she had won, for the Kingwould never break a promise coupled with&#xA;that beloved name.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do you promise? Very well!&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;exclaimed. &amp;ldquo;Swear again in the name of&#xA;Rama that you will do what I wish&#xA;without fail. Swear it!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King said: &amp;ldquo;My beloved queen, I&#xA;promise. I swear it on Rama. Whatever&#xA;you wish I shall do. This is my sworn&#xA;word.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At this stage, as she thought of the&#xA;tremendousness of her intended request,&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s heart misgave her and she&#xA;feared that on hearing it her horror-&#xA;stricken husband would exclaim: &amp;lsquo;God&#xA;forbid! No oath or promise is strong&#xA;enough to justify so heinous a sin!&amp;rsquo; and&#xA;recoil from her with abhorrence.&#xA;She stood erect and with folded hands,&#xA;turning in the four directions, invoked in a&#xA;solemn voice the heavenly powers to&#xA;witness and confirm the oath: &amp;ldquo;Oh, Ye&#xA;Gods! You have heard and witnessed the&#xA;promise given to me by my husband. Sun,&#xA;Moon and Planets, you are my holy&#xA;witnesses. Ye, Five Elements! You have&#xA;heard the promise. He who has never&#xA;broken his word, my husband, has sworn&#xA;to do my wish. Bear witness to this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha was looking at her with&#xA;hungry, joyous eyes. She knew her man&#xA;and she began boldly: &amp;ldquo;Do you remember,&#xA;King, how, when long ago in the field of&#xA;battle you were about to lose your life, I&#xA;drove your chariot in the dark night, took&#xA;you out of the battlefield, removed the&#xA;arrows from your body and comforted and&#xA;revived you? When you came out of your&#xA;faint, you said something, did you not?&#xA;You said: &amp;lsquo;You have restored to me the&#xA;life which my foes had taken from me. I&#xA;shall give you any two gifts you ask.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Then I said: &amp;lsquo;I want nothing now. It is joy&#xA;enough now for me that you are alive. I&#xA;shall ask for my gifts later.&amp;rsquo; Do you&#xA;remember this?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King answered: &amp;ldquo;Yes, I do&#xA;remember this. Ask for your two gifts.&#xA;You shall have them now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi said: &amp;ldquo;Remember you have&#xA;made a vow. You have given a pledge.&#xA;You have sworn in the name of Rama.&#xA;The gods and the five elements have&#xA;witnessed your promise. I shall state my&#xA;wishes. Your ancestors never broke their&#xA;word. Prove yourself their worthy&#xA;descendant by being true to the word you&#xA;have given. With the preparations now&#xA;afoot for the coronation, crown my son&#xA;Bharata. This is my first wish. The second&#xA;boon that I demand is, send your son&#xA;Rama to live in the Dandaka forest for&#xA;fourteen years. Remember your solemn&#xA;vow that you cannot break. The good&#xA;fame of your great dynasty is in your&#xA;hands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>14 WIFE OR DEMON?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dasaratha was thunder-struck.&#xA;When his mind resumed its function,&#xA;he doubted the reality of what had&#xA;happened. &amp;ldquo;Could it be other than a&#xA;hideous dream? Or the phantasmagoria of&#xA;a disordered brain? Or the sudden&#xA;materialisation of the sins of some past&#xA;birth called up for my chastisement? I am&#xA;certainly the victim of an illusion. I cannot&#xA;believe this to be reality.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unable to stand the confused agony of&#xA;shapeless terrors, he closed his eyes and&#xA;became unconscious. Opening his eyes a&#xA;little later, they fell on Kaikeyi and he&#xA;trembled like a stag at the sight of a tiger.&#xA;He sat up on the floor and moaned,&#xA;swaying helplessly this side and that like a&#xA;cobra held by the spell of a potent charm.&#xA;Again he swooned.&#xA;After a long interval, be recovered his&#xA;senses and, with eyes turned to his&#xA;tormentor and inflamed with helpless&#xA;anger, cried out: &amp;ldquo;O wicked ogress!&#xA;Destroyer of my dynasty! What harm has&#xA;Rama done to you? Has he not lookedupon you as his own mother? I thought&#xA;you were a woman. I now see you are a&#xA;venomous serpent brought from far away&#xA;and cherished in my bosom only to sting&#xA;me to death!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi was unmoved and spoke not a&#xA;word.&#xA;The King went on: &amp;ldquo;On what pretext&#xA;can I banish Rama, whom all the people&#xA;love and praise? I may lose Kausalya and&#xA;survive. I may lose the pure-minded&#xA;Sumitra and survive. But if I lose Rama, I&#xA;cannot live thereafter. Without water,&#xA;without sunlight, I may live for a while,&#xA;but never without Rama. Expel from your&#xA;mind this sinful thought. With my head&#xA;bowed at your feet, I beg of you. Have&#xA;you not said many a time, &amp;lsquo;Two dear sons&#xA;I have. And of them Rama, the elder, is&#xA;dearer to me&amp;rsquo;? In deciding to crown Rama,&#xA;what have I done but carry out in action&#xA;your unspoken wish? Why then do you&#xA;demand these cruel boons? No, no, it&#xA;cannot be really that you mean this. You&#xA;are only testing me to find out if I indeed&#xA;love your son Bharata. Do not, through a&#xA;great sin, destroy our famous line of&#xA;Kings.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even then Kaikeyi spoke no word, but&#xA;her eyes blazed scornful anger.&#xA;The King continued: &amp;ldquo;Till this day you&#xA;have done nothing to cause me sorrow,&#xA;never spoken an unworthy word. Who has&#xA;corrupted you now? I cannot believe that&#xA;this evil thought is your own. How often&#xA;have you told me, my dear, that, noble as&#xA;Bharata is, Rama is nobler still? Is it the&#xA;same Rama that you now want to be sent&#xA;to the forest? How can he dwell in the&#xA;forest? How can you even entertain the&#xA;thought of his going away into the&#xA;wilderness infested by ferocious beasts?&#xA;How lovingly has Rama treated you and&#xA;served you! How can you forget all this&#xA;and steel your heart and utter the words,&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Send him to the forest&amp;rsquo;? What fault has he&#xA;committed? Of the hundreds of women in&#xA;the palace, has anyone ever uttered a word&#xA;against his honor or virtue? The whole&#xA;world loves him for his great and good&#xA;qualities. How did you alone among so&#xA;many find cause to dislike him? Is not&#xA;Rama like Indra himself? Is not his face&#xA;radiant with goodness and spiritual light&#xA;like a rishi&amp;rsquo;s? The whole world praises his&#xA;truthfulness and friendliness, his learning&#xA;and wisdom, his heroism and humility. No&#xA;one has heard a harsh word from his lips.&#xA;How can I, his father, say to him &amp;lsquo;Son, go&#xA;to the forest&amp;rsquo;? This can never be. Have&#xA;mercy on me, an old man nearing the end&#xA;of his days. Kaikeyi, ask for anything else&#xA;in this kingdom, ask for everything else,&#xA;and I will give. With folded hands, I beg&#xA;you, do not send me to Yama. Clinging to&#xA;your feet I beg you, I beg you humbly,&#xA;save Rama! Save me from sin!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To the King thus struggling in a sea of&#xA;grief, pitiless Kaikeyi spoke cruel words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King, if having promised the boons&#xA;you regret it and will be forsworn, what&#xA;sort of king would you be and what right&#xA;would you have to speak of satya and&#xA;dharma? How can you face other kings?&#xA;Will you shamelessly confess to them,&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Yes, Kaikeyi saved me from death and I&#xA;gave her a promise. Later, I was sorry I&#xA;gave it and I broke it&amp;rsquo;? What else could&#xA;you tell them? All monarchs will shun you&#xA;as a disgrace to their order! And common&#xA;people will laugh in scorn at their rulers&#xA;and say, &amp;lsquo;Kings break promises even when&#xA;given to their queens. Do not expect kings&#xA;to keep their word.&amp;rsquo; Do you not know that&#xA;Saibya, to redeem the pledge he gave to a&#xA;bird, cut the very flesh off his bones and&#xA;gave it away? Have you not heard of&#xA;Alarka who plucked his eyes out to keep&#xA;his word? The sea stays within its limits&#xA;and does not overflow the land, because it&#xA;feels bound by its agreement. Do not&#xA;violate your solemn pledge. Follow thepath of your royal ancestors. O, I fear that&#xA;you, their unworthy descendant, will&#xA;forsake dharma; you will crown Rama and&#xA;you will dally with Kausalya. What do&#xA;you care what happens to dharma? What&#xA;do you care what happens to satya? If you&#xA;deny me the gifts you promised on oath, I&#xA;shall this very night drink poison and end&#xA;my life. You may anoint and install Rama,&#xA;but before your eyes, O, promise breaker,&#xA;I shall be dead. This is certain. And I&#xA;swear it in the name of Bharata. It will be&#xA;well and good if you fulfil your promise&#xA;and banish Rama to the forest. Else, I&#xA;shall end my life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With this firm declaration, Kaikeyi&#xA;stopped. Dasaratha stood speechless,&#xA;staring at his pitiless wife. Was this lovely&#xA;creation really Kaikeyi or a demon? Then,&#xA;like a huge tree felled by a forester with&#xA;his axe, the King shook and toppled down&#xA;and lay stretched unconscious on the floor&#xA;in pitiful ruin.&#xA;Regaining his senses after a while, he&#xA;spoke in a low voice: &amp;ldquo;Kaikeyi, who has&#xA;corrupted your mind to see me dead and&#xA;our race destroyed? What evil spirit has&#xA;possessed you and makes you dance in&#xA;this shameless fashion? Do you really&#xA;think that Bharata will agree to be king&#xA;after sending Rama to the forest? He&#xA;never will, and you know it. Can I&#xA;possibly bear to tell Rama to go to the&#xA;forest? Will not the kings of the world&#xA;despise me, saying, &amp;lsquo;This uxorious old&#xA;dotard has banished his eldest son, the&#xA;best of men&amp;rsquo;? Don&amp;rsquo;t you see that they&#xA;would laugh at me? It is easy enough for&#xA;you to say &amp;lsquo;Send Rama away to the forest,&amp;rsquo;&#xA;but can Kausalya or I survive his&#xA;departure? And have you thought of&#xA;Janaka&amp;rsquo;s daughter? Would it not kill her to&#xA;hear that Rama is to go away to the&#xA;Dandaka forest? Cheated by your face I&#xA;thought you a woman and took you for&#xA;my wife. Like a deluded man, tempted by&#xA;the flavor of poisoned wine, I was lured&#xA;by your beauty into marrying you. Like a&#xA;deer ensnared by a hunter, I am caught in&#xA;your net and perish. Like a drunken&#xA;Brahmana in the streets I shall be&#xA;universally despised. What boons have&#xA;you demanded? Boons that forever will&#xA;taint the fame of our dynasty with the&#xA;ignominy of lustful dotage that drove an&#xA;old fool to the banishment of a beloved&#xA;and peerless son. If I tell Rama to go to&#xA;the forest, yes, he will cheerfully obey and&#xA;go to the forest. Myself and then Kausalya&#xA;and Sumitra will die. How will you enjoy&#xA;the kingdom thus secured, O sinful,&#xA;foolish woman? And will Bharata agree to&#xA;your plans? If he does agree, he shall not&#xA;perform my obsequies. O shameless&#xA;woman, my life&amp;rsquo;s enemy, kill your&#xA;husband and attain widowhood to enjoy&#xA;the kingdom with your son. O, how sinful&#xA;are women and how pitiless! No, no. Only&#xA;this woman is cruel. Why should I insult&#xA;other women? What a pity that my&#xA;Bharata should have this monster for a&#xA;mother! No, I can never do this. Kaikeyi, I&#xA;fall at your feet and beg you. Have some&#xA;pity on me!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King rolled on the ground and&#xA;writhed in agony. What shall we say of&#xA;this scene? A great emperor, famous for&#xA;his long and glorious reign, crying and&#xA;rolling on the ground, clasping his wife&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;feet and begging for mercy. It was like&#xA;Yayati, thrown back to earth when, his&#xA;accumulated merit exhausted, he was&#xA;ejected from Swarga.&#xA;No matter how humbly he begged,&#xA;Kaikeyi was obstinate and said firmly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have yourself boasted that you are a&#xA;truth speaker. But now having sworn&#xA;before the gods that you have granted a&#xA;boon, you attempt to retract your promise.&#xA;If you break your word, I shall surely kill&#xA;myself and that, will not add greatly to theglory of your dynasty, of which you are so&#xA;proud!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Very well, then,&amp;rdquo; said Dasaratha. &amp;ldquo;Let&#xA;Rama go to the forest and let me die.&#xA;Having destroyed me and my race, a&#xA;jubilant widow, you will gain your wish&#xA;and seek joy in your life!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again, after a while, the old King&#xA;cried: &amp;ldquo;What good you will gain by&#xA;sending Rama to the forest, I fail to see.&#xA;The only result will be that the whole&#xA;world will despise you. After many years&#xA;of prayer and penance, I had Rama by the&#xA;grace of God. And him I now banish into&#xA;the forest, I, most wretched of men!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lifting his eyes to the sky, he said: &amp;ldquo;Oh&#xA;night! Stay on. For when you pass and day&#xA;dawns, what shall I do? What shall I say&#xA;to those eager crowds, who, full of love&#xA;for Rama, will be awaiting the coronation&#xA;festivities? O heavens! Stay still for my&#xA;sake with your stars! No, no. Stay not, for&#xA;then I must keep looking at this sinful&#xA;woman. Depart at once, O night, so that I&#xA;may escape this face.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus delirious and conscious by turns,&#xA;the poor old man suffered agony, a king&#xA;who had reigned for sixty thousand years.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Pity me, Kaikeyi,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Forget the&#xA;harsh things I uttered .in anger. I beg you&#xA;in the name of the love you bore me. You&#xA;may take it that I have given the kingdom&#xA;to you. It is yours. And you can give it&#xA;with your own hands to Rama and see that&#xA;the coronation goes through. The Raja&#xA;Sabha has decided and I have announced&#xA;to the elders and to Rama that his&#xA;coronation is to take place tomorrow. Let&#xA;not this announcement become false.&#xA;Have pity on me. Give the kingdom as&#xA;you own to Rama. The fame of this&#xA;magnanimous gift will last as long as the&#xA;world endures. My wish, the people&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wish, the Elders&amp;rsquo; wish, Bharata&amp;rsquo;s wish,&#xA;they are all that Rama should be crowned.&#xA;Do this, my love, my life.&amp;rdquo; Again the&#xA;King clung to the feet of Kaikeyi.&#xA;But she answered: &amp;ldquo;Have done with&#xA;this foolery, see that you do not break&#xA;your word and drive me to keep mine, and&#xA;kill myself. It is useless for you to try to&#xA;evade.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King said: &amp;ldquo;With due rites and in&#xA;the presence of Fire, I took your hand and&#xA;called you wife. Here and now I renounce&#xA;you, and with you the son you bore. Night&#xA;is gone; the dawn is near and the morning&#xA;will see not Rama&amp;rsquo;s coronation, but my&#xA;funeral.&amp;rdquo; Kaikeyi cut him short: &amp;ldquo;You are&#xA;prattling vainly. Send at once for Rama.&#xA;Let him come here. Tell him the kingdom&#xA;is Bharata&amp;rsquo;s and he should go to the forest.&#xA;Keep your promise. Do not waste time.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha groaned: &amp;ldquo;Very well. Let me&#xA;at last set eyes on Rama&amp;rsquo;s face. My death&#xA;is near. Let Rama come. Let me see his&#xA;face before I die. Tied down by dharma&#xA;this old fool is helpless.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And again he fell unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>15 BEHOLD A WONDER!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;POOR Dasaratha was in extreme&#xA;agony, pulled by natural affection on one&#xA;side and by the moral obligation to fulfil a&#xA;pledge on the other. He had fondly hoped&#xA;that Kaikeyi would relent and that&#xA;somehow the conflict of duties would be&#xA;resolved. But now he saw that this was not&#xA;to be.&#xA;He had still one faint hope: &amp;ldquo;Rama is in&#xA;no way bound by my promises and&#xA;pledges. Strong as he is in people&amp;rsquo;s love&#xA;and in his peerless prowess, he may&#xA;disregard my promise, and stand on his&#xA;own rights. But I cannot conceive his&#xA;doing so, for my slightest wish has always&#xA;been sacred to him. Yet, if by some&#xA;chance he did so, it would save the&#xA;situation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the confusion and anguish of his&#xA;heart, the old King consoled himself with&#xA;such false hopes, forgetting that Ramawould never think of disregarding his&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s promise and that filial obedience&#xA;was a fundamental rule of his life.&#xA;But the false hopes did not persist long.&#xA;He felt that his death was near. In this&#xA;agonising conflict of duties, death would&#xA;be a relief, and save him from the&#xA;disruption and sorrows to come.&#xA;As death drew near, his mind recalled&#xA;past events. He remembered a great sin&#xA;committed by him in youth. He felt that he&#xA;was now reaping what he then sowed: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;killed the Rishi&amp;rsquo;s son and brought grief to&#xA;his aged parents. How could this sin be&#xA;wiped off except by my suffering the&#xA;anguish of losing a dear son?&amp;rdquo; Thus&#xA;Dasaratha resigned himself to his fate as a&#xA;just retribution for the wrong he had once&#xA;done.&#xA;He concluded that be had no alternative&#xA;but to fulfil his word to his cruel wife and&#xA;left the ordering of things entirely to&#xA;Kaikeyi.&#xA;Day dawned. The hour fixed for the&#xA;coronation&#xA;was&#xA;approaching.&#xA;The&#xA;procession of Vasishtha and his disciples&#xA;carrying the golden vessels containing the&#xA;waters of holy rivers was coming towards&#xA;the palace.&#xA;The great street was decorated and was&#xA;crowded with eager men and women.&#xA;They rejoiced to see Vasishtha and his&#xA;disciples march to the palace with the holy&#xA;waters, and the paraphernalia of&#xA;installation. As they saw the honey, curds,&#xA;clarified butter, fried rice, sacred grass,&#xA;flowers, maidens, elephants, horses and&#xA;chariots, the white umbrella, the bull, the&#xA;horse and the tiger-skin seat moving to the&#xA;accompaniment of music from many&#xA;instruments, the people made loud and&#xA;jubilant acclamations which filled the air.&#xA;Vasishtha, approaching the palace gate,&#xA;saw Sumantra and said to him: &amp;ldquo;Pray, go&#xA;in at once and inform the King that the&#xA;people are waiting and all preparations are&#xA;complete.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sumantra approached the King&amp;rsquo;s bed-&#xA;chamber and chanting the morning hymn,&#xA;conveyed Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s message. &amp;ldquo;Oh&#xA;King,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;arise from slumber to the&#xA;hymn of your charioteer as the king of the&#xA;gods does to Matali&amp;rsquo;s waking songs. May&#xA;all the gods be gracious unto you. The&#xA;elders, generals, and chief citizens are&#xA;waiting for your darshan. The goddess of&#xA;night has withdrawn. The day&amp;rsquo;s work&#xA;awaits your ordering. Oh King of kings,&#xA;be pleased to rise. Holy Vasishtha and his&#xA;men are waiting.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At that moment the King was&#xA;speechless with agony, but Kaikeyi boldly&#xA;answered for him and told Sumantra: &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;King spent the night talking of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;coronation and had no sleep. So now he is&#xA;in a slumber. Go at once and bring Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus the clever woman sent Sumantra&#xA;to fetch Rama to convey the King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;command. She knew that Dasaratha had&#xA;agreed but had not the strength to do what&#xA;had to be done. Hence Kaikeyi resolved&#xA;that she would herself do what needed to&#xA;be done.&#xA;Sumantra went to Rama&amp;rsquo;s palace. Sita&#xA;and Rama were getting ready for&#xA;coronation. Then Sumantra gave to Rama&#xA;the message that the King and Queen&#xA;Kaikeyi wanted his presence. Rama&#xA;hastened to obey.&#xA;The unexpected delay and these&#xA;strange goings and comings roused&#xA;doubts, but no one dared to talk of them.&#xA;The men concerned hoped that somehow&#xA;things would turn out right and went on&#xA;with their allotted work.&#xA;The streets were brightly decorated; the&#xA;great hour was approaching as in the&#xA;Queen&amp;rsquo;s chamber strange and sinister&#xA;events were developing.&amp;ldquo;Why this long delay?&amp;rdquo; the people&#xA;wondered. &amp;ldquo;Perhaps the preliminary rites&#xA;are more elaborate than we had thought.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The crowds in the streets grew bigger&#xA;and bigger and more impatient.&#xA;Sumantra accompanied Rama to&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s palace, treading the way with&#xA;difficulty through the throng. Rama&#xA;entered the Queen&amp;rsquo;s apartment. As he&#xA;stepped over the threshold, he started as if&#xA;he had set his foot upon a snake, for he&#xA;saw with awe-struck amazement his father&#xA;lying on the bare floor in anguish. The&#xA;King evidently had been struck down with&#xA;some great sorrow. His face was like a&#xA;parijata blossom wilted in the sun.&#xA;He touched his father&amp;rsquo;s feet and paid&#xA;the same filial worship to Kaikeyi.&#xA;Dasaratha uttered in a low voice the&#xA;name of Rama and stopped. He could&#xA;speak no more. He could not look straight&#xA;into the face of Rama.&#xA;Rama was perplexed and filled with&#xA;apprehension at the sight of his father,&#xA;lying there unable to speak, in the grip of&#xA;some great agony. What it could be Rama&#xA;could not even guess.&#xA;He turned to Kaikeyi and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother, this is indeed strange. No matter&#xA;how angry he was, my father would speak&#xA;sweetly to me. Have I without knowing it&#xA;offended him in any matter? Has some&#xA;sudden sickness struck him down? Has&#xA;someone spoken rudely to him? Do tell&#xA;me what has happened. I can bear this&#xA;suspense no longer.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bold Kaikeyi seized the chance and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;The King is angry with no one.&#xA;There is nothing wrong with his health.&#xA;But there is something in his mind which&#xA;he is afraid to tell you. That is all. He is&#xA;afraid to say it to you, lest you should feel&#xA;hurt. That is why he is silent. Once upon a&#xA;time, pleased with me he offered, and I&#xA;accepted, the gift to two boons. Now, like&#xA;an uncultured person, the King regrets he&#xA;did so. Is this worthy of him? Is it not&#xA;unbecoming of a King to pledge his word&#xA;and then regret it? You have the power to&#xA;fulfil his promise, but he fears even to tell&#xA;you of it and is thinking of violating it.&#xA;Would it be right? If you assure him that&#xA;he need not be anxious about your attitude&#xA;and that he should keep his word at all&#xA;costs, you will give him the needed&#xA;strength to behave righteously. You must&#xA;give him the help he needs. The thing is in&#xA;your hands. I shall tell you what it is, but&#xA;after you promise me that you will help&#xA;the King to fulfil his pledge.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama, saddened at the thought that he&#xA;should in any way be the occasion of&#xA;distress to his father, said to Kaikeyi:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother, am I indeed the cause of all this&#xA;trouble? I do not deserve that you should&#xA;have any doubts about me. If my father&#xA;asks me to jump into the fire, I shall not&#xA;hesitate to do it. If he asks me to drink&#xA;poison, I shall drink it without hesitation.&#xA;You know this. You know well enough&#xA;that at his bidding I would drown myself&#xA;in the sea. Here mother, I give you my&#xA;solemn promise that I shall fulfil the&#xA;King&amp;rsquo;s promise to you, and I never break&#xA;my word.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Rama uttered these words,&#xA;Kaikeyi exulted, for she knew she had&#xA;conquered. The King for his part was in&#xA;despair, seeing that all escape was now&#xA;barred.&#xA;Thereupon the pitiless Kaikeyi uttered&#xA;these terrible words: &amp;ldquo;Rama, your words&#xA;are worthy of you. What higher duty has a&#xA;son than helping fulfilment of the word&#xA;his father has given? Now I shall let you&#xA;know your father&amp;rsquo;s promise to me. When&#xA;in the battle with Sambara your father was&#xA;wounded, I rescued and revived him.&#xA;Your father in gratitude for having been&#xA;rescued by me when grievously wounded&#xA;gave me two boons to be claimed and&#xA;specified when I choose. I have claimedand specified them now. They are that&#xA;Bharata should be anointed Yuvaraja and&#xA;that you should be sent away this very day&#xA;to the Dandaka forest, to remain in exile&#xA;for fourteen years. You have sworn&#xA;solemnly to carry out his promise to me,&#xA;and now it is your duty to prove true to&#xA;your pledged word. If you find right&#xA;conduct as hard as your father did, that is&#xA;another matter. Otherwise, listen to what I&#xA;say. It is for you now to relinquish the&#xA;installation and to go out into exile with&#xA;matted locks and hermit weeds, leaving&#xA;the preparations now ready to serve for&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s installation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When she uttered these cruel words the&#xA;King writhed in agony, but Rama heard&#xA;her untroubled. Kaikeyi beheld a miracle.&#xA;There was not the slightest sign of&#xA;disappointment or sorrow in Rama&amp;rsquo;s face.&#xA;Smiling, the Prince said: &amp;ldquo;Is that all,&#xA;mother? Surely, the King&amp;rsquo;s promise must&#xA;be fulfilled. My hair shall be twisted and I&#xA;shall wear the bark and I shall go this very&#xA;day to the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi spoke prophetic words when&#xA;she said Rama&amp;rsquo;s dutifulness would bring&#xA;him glory undying. That glory will&#xA;continue as long as the Himalaya stands&#xA;and the waters of Ganga flow and as long&#xA;as the ocean-waves beat on the solid earth.&#xA;Rama said to Kaikeyi, in unperturbed&#xA;tones: &amp;ldquo;I am not in the least annoyed.&#xA;Would I not be happy to give anything to&#xA;Bharata? Even if no one asked me, I&#xA;would cheerfully give him my all. And&#xA;how can I hold back a moment when my&#xA;father commands it? What pains me a&#xA;little is that father should have entertained&#xA;any doubt about my willingness. Why&#xA;should he have hesitated to tell me what&#xA;he wanted and left it to you to say it to&#xA;me? Am I not his son, bound to do his&#xA;behest? What glory or what joy can I look&#xA;for except to make good his word? How&#xA;did I deserve it that my father should avert&#xA;his face from me and refrain from&#xA;speaking loving words to me? My&#xA;grievance, if at all, is that he did not send&#xA;for me straight and give me his command.&#xA;I shall go to the forest this very day, with&#xA;no regret. Send swift messengers at once&#xA;to fetch Bharata home.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Prince&amp;rsquo;s face glowed like a&#xA;sacrificial fire bursting into flame as the&#xA;ghee is poured into it. Kaikeyi felt glad at&#xA;her apparent success. She could not look&#xA;into the future and its sorrow, for what&#xA;greater grief can come to a woman than&#xA;the scorn of her own son? Greed deceived&#xA;her into folly. It prevented her from&#xA;understanding aright the mind of her own&#xA;son Bharata.&#xA;Like a captive elephant hemmed in on&#xA;all sides, Dasaratha lay in anguish. With&#xA;needless harshness, Kaikeyi hurried Rama&#xA;saying, &amp;ldquo;Do not wait for the King to speak&#xA;and prolong the affair.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At this Rama said: &amp;ldquo;Mother, you have&#xA;not, it seems, known me. I value no&#xA;pleasure higher than to honor my father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;pledge. Let Bharata carry the burden of&#xA;kingship, and look after our aged father. It&#xA;will indeed give me the greatest joy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha, silent till now though&#xA;listening intently, moaned aloud. Rama&#xA;touched the feet of his father and Kaikeyi&#xA;and hurried out of the chamber.&#xA;Lakshmana had been standing outside. He&#xA;knew what had happened and with eyes&#xA;red with anger he followed Rama.&#xA;On the way Rama saw the vessels&#xA;holding the consecrated water for the&#xA;coronation. He walked round them in&#xA;worship. With calm majesty lie left behind&#xA;the white umbrella and other royal&#xA;insignia and advised the crowds to&#xA;disperse. The Prince, in whom desire had&#xA;been vanquished, went to the house of&#xA;Queen Kausalya to give her the news and&#xA;take her blessings before departing to the&#xA;forest.Readers&#xA;should&#xA;exercise&#xA;their&#xA;imagination and build up in their own&#xA;hearts the passions and sorrows of the&#xA;persons figuring in this epic. Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;anguish, Rama&amp;rsquo;s cheerful renunciation and&#xA;the greedy passion of Kaikeyi which&#xA;smothered all noble impulses these are&#xA;familiar phases in our daily lives.&#xA;Valmiki and Kamban saw with the&#xA;vision of genius and made the events in&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s story live again in song. We too&#xA;should see them through imagination.&#xA;This is the meaning of the tradition that&#xA;wherever Rama&amp;rsquo;s tale is told Hanuman&#xA;himself joins the gathering and reverently&#xA;stands listening with tear-filled eyes. May&#xA;everyone that reads this chapter receive by&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s grace and strength to bear the&#xA;sorrows that have to be faced in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAMA went to Queen Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;dwelling. Many visitors were assembled&#xA;there, eagerly awaiting the coronation. In&#xA;the innermost apartment, the Queen, clad&#xA;in white silk, was before the sacrificial&#xA;fire invoking blessings on her son.&#xA;As soon as Rama entered, she&#xA;embraced him and showed him, who she&#xA;thought, was to become the Yuvaraja, to a&#xA;specially raised seat.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother, this seat is now too high for&#xA;me,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. &amp;ldquo;I am a hermit and&#xA;should sit on grass spread on the floor. I&#xA;have brought you news, which may&#xA;sadden you. Listen, and give me your&#xA;blessings.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he told her briefly what had&#xA;happened: &amp;ldquo;The King wishes to give the&#xA;crown to Bharata. His command is that I&#xA;should spend fourteen years in the&#xA;Dandaka forest. I must leave today,&#xA;mother, and I come for your blessings&#xA;before I go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Kausalya heard this, she fell on&#xA;the ground like a plantain tree suddenly&#xA;cut down. Lakshmana and Rama gently&#xA;raised her.&#xA;She clung to Rama and cried: &amp;ldquo;Is my&#xA;heart made of stone or iron that I still&#xA;live?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana could not bear the sight of&#xA;the Queen&amp;rsquo;s grief. Angrily he spoke: &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;old King has pronounced on Rama a&#xA;doom that is reserved for the most wicked&#xA;evil-doers. What sin or crime has Rama&#xA;committed? Not even his worst enemy&#xA;could find any fault in Rama. The doting&#xA;old man has lost his senses over his young&#xA;wife and is not fit to be king any more.&#xA;How can a king listen to a woman and&#xA;violate dharma? Even your enemies, O!&#xA;Rama, when they look at you begin to&#xA;love you, but this dotard of a father sends&#xA;you to the forest. Look here, brother, let&#xA;us together throw out this King and take&#xA;charge of the kingdom. Who will dare&#xA;oppose us? I shall make an end of anyone&#xA;who dares. Only give me leave and I shall&#xA;do this single-handed. A young brother to&#xA;become King and you to go to the forest!&#xA;The world would laugh at this absurdity.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t consent to this. I at any rate won&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;stand this. I shall put down all opposition&#xA;and see that you rule the kingdom without&#xA;delay or hindrance. Never doubt but I&#xA;have strength to do it. Instead of the sun&#xA;rising, a great darkness has descended&#xA;upon the land this morning, for when we&#xA;were expecting your coronation the King&#xA;sentences you to banishment! In the face&#xA;of such injustice there is no use being nice&#xA;and polite. I cannot stand this. I must do&#xA;my duty. Mother, now you will see the&#xA;strength of my arm and so will you,&#xA;brother.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s words were some solace&#xA;to Kausalya, but yet this strange talk of&#xA;ousting the King and seizing the throne&#xA;frightened her.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;Rama, consider well what&#xA;Lakshmana says. Don&amp;rsquo;t go to the forest. Ifyou go away, how can I stay here all alone&#xA;among enemies? I too shall go with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama had listened in silence to&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s outburst, for it was wise to&#xA;let the pent up passion find outlet in&#xA;words. Then, turning to Kausalya he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother, let there be no talk of anyone&#xA;going with me to the forest. It is your duty&#xA;to stay here serving the King and sharing&#xA;the sorrow that has come to him in his old&#xA;age. How can the crowned Queen of an&#xA;Emperor wander with me like a widow in&#xA;the forest? This cannot be. I shall return&#xA;after my term of forest life. It is my duty&#xA;to fulfil my father&amp;rsquo;s word. It is all the same&#xA;to me, whether it is just or unjust,&#xA;spontaneous or extorted by force or fraud.&#xA;If I fail in this primary duty, I can gain no&#xA;satisfaction or good name through any&#xA;amount of wealth or power. Lakshmana,&#xA;your proposals are quite wrong. I know&#xA;your great strength and I have no doubt&#xA;that you can vanquish and destroy all&#xA;opponents and secure for me the kingdom.&#xA;I know also your affection for me. But the&#xA;way in which you propose to use it is not&#xA;worthy of the dynasty to which we&#xA;belong. Our highest duty is to fulfil our&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s word. If we fail in that, no other&#xA;achievement can make up for it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama tried to console both his mother&#xA;and his brother, but Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s anger&#xA;could not be easily put down. Perhaps it&#xA;could have been, if he himself, not Rama,&#xA;were the sufferer. But it was Rama who&#xA;was the victim of this cruel injustice. And&#xA;so Lakshmana writhed in anger like a&#xA;wounded cobra. Rama took him apart,&#xA;made him sit down and tried to calm him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, are you not my other self,&#xA;my very soul in another body? Listen to&#xA;me. You are courageous and strong.&#xA;Control your anger and grief on my&#xA;account. Don&amp;rsquo;t allow these evil spirits to&#xA;possess you. Holding fast to dharma, let&#xA;us convert our present disgrace into a&#xA;great joy. Let us forget all about the&#xA;coronation, and think worthily as becomes&#xA;our race. Consider our father&amp;rsquo;s condition.&#xA;Our hearts should go out to him in&#xA;sympathy, for he is stricken with a great&#xA;sorrow. Whatever be the reason, he gave a&#xA;promise and if he should break it, he&#xA;would be committing a shameful sin&#xA;which would besmirch and blot out all his&#xA;great and glorious deeds. He is heart-&#xA;broken at the wrong he feels he has done&#xA;me. But I do not feel it a wrong at all, for&#xA;a king must keep his word and a son must&#xA;obey his father. You should show that you&#xA;too are free from any sense of injury. Only&#xA;so can we bring him mental relief. He&#xA;gave us the life that we hold and we&#xA;should give him peace of mind. He is&#xA;afraid about the other world. We should&#xA;free him from this fear. So far, we have&#xA;never given him cause for sorrow or&#xA;dissatisfaction. Now we have become the&#xA;cause of a great fear in his mind about&#xA;what is to happen to him in the other&#xA;world. We can easily relieve him. Instead&#xA;of doing this, are we to add to his&#xA;troubles? For this reason my mind has&#xA;altogether&#xA;turned&#xA;away&#xA;from&#xA;the&#xA;coronation and is intent on the journey to&#xA;the forest. My sole desire now is to go to&#xA;the forest and see that Bharata is crowned.&#xA;This would please me best. If I delay,&#xA;Kaikeyi will grow suspicious. Hence I&#xA;should go to the forest this very day and&#xA;bring peace to her mind. Rid of the fear of&#xA;the sin of breaking a promise and assured&#xA;of my willing and cheerful acceptance of&#xA;his command, our father will be happy.&#xA;And we should not be angry with Kaikeyi&#xA;either. Has she not been kind to us all&#xA;these years? That she should suddenly&#xA;conceive this idea is surely the working of&#xA;fate. We should not blame her for it. One&#xA;proposes something and fate decides&#xA;otherwise. In this, Kaikeyi is but a passive&#xA;instrument in the hand of fate. Our littlemother will have to bear the grievous&#xA;burden of the world&amp;rsquo;s blame, but our love&#xA;for her should remain the same as ever. If,&#xA;before this, there had been evil in her&#xA;thought, her conduct would have shown it.&#xA;There is no doubt that some higher force&#xA;has made her say suddenly and harshly,&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Rama, go to the forest.&amp;rsquo; Otherwise how&#xA;could a high-minded woman who so far&#xA;looked upon us as her own children now&#xA;behave so brazenly before her husband?&#xA;Who can oppose destiny? Even steadfast&#xA;sages have swerved suddenly from their&#xA;tapas. How can poor Kaikeyi hope to&#xA;resist fate? Let us resolve firmly to change&#xA;this sorrow into joy. That would be a&#xA;proof of our nobility and courage,&#xA;Lakshmana. With the blessings of my&#xA;mothers and elders, I shall go to the forest.&#xA;Bring here the water, the water from the&#xA;Ganga for the coronation. I shall use it for&#xA;ablution before departing for the forest.&#xA;No. no, that water belongs to the State and&#xA;is intended for the coronation. How can&#xA;we touch it? We shall go to holy Ganga&#xA;ourselves and fetch the water for my&#xA;ablution. Brother, be not sad thinking of&#xA;kingdom or wealth; life in the forest will&#xA;be my highest joy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So Rama revealed to his brother his&#xA;inmost thoughts. In these passages&#xA;Valmiki uses the word daiva. In Sanskrit&#xA;literature, daivam means fate. Daivam,&#xA;dishtam, bhagyam, niyati and vidhi are all&#xA;words conveying the idea of something&#xA;unexpected and inexplicable. Because of&#xA;the belief in God as the Prime Cause, a&#xA;natural confusion arises between fate and&#xA;God&amp;rsquo;s will. What Rama said to Lakshmana&#xA;on the present occasion does not mean&#xA;that he thought that the gods contrived&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s action for their own benefit.&#xA;Rama offered no more than the usual&#xA;consolation: &amp;ldquo;It is the work of fate. Do not&#xA;grieve. No one is to blame for this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the Kamban Ramayana also,&#xA;addressing his brother &amp;lsquo;raging like the fire&#xA;of dissolution,&amp;rsquo; Rama says: &amp;ldquo;It is not the&#xA;river&amp;rsquo;s fault that the bed is dry. Even so,&#xA;my going hence is not the King&amp;rsquo;s fault, nor&#xA;Queen Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s nor her son&amp;rsquo;s. The wrong&#xA;is the work of fate. Why should one be&#xA;angry then?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This explanation calmed Lakshmana&#xA;for a while. But soon his anger boiled up&#xA;again. He said: &amp;ldquo;Very well, then. This is&#xA;the work of fate. Fate, I grant, is the cause&#xA;of our step-mother&amp;rsquo;s sudden folly. And I&#xA;am not angry with her. But are we, on that&#xA;account, to sit still and do nothing? It is&#xA;Kshatriya dharma to overcome evil and&#xA;establish justice. A hero does not bow&#xA;down before fate. Having announced&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s coronation by beat of drum to the&#xA;town and country, the treacherous King&#xA;invokes some old forgotten boon and&#xA;orders you to go to the forest. Is it manly&#xA;to call this fate and obey it meekly? Only&#xA;cowards go down under fate. Heroes&#xA;should oppose and vanquish it. I am no&#xA;weakling to yield to fate. You will see&#xA;today the might of a hero matched against&#xA;fate. I shall tame the mad elephant fate&#xA;and make it serve me. I shall banish to the&#xA;forest those who conspired to banish you.&#xA;If you wish to visit the forest for a change,&#xA;you can do so later. The proper time for it&#xA;will be when you have reigned as king for&#xA;many years and then entrusted the crown&#xA;to your sons. That was the way of our&#xA;ancestors. If anyone questions your&#xA;kingship now, I stand here to annihilate&#xA;him. Are these two shoulders merely for&#xA;beauty? This bow, these arrows and this&#xA;sword hanging on my side are they mere&#xA;decorations? Or do you think they are&#xA;theatrical equipment put on for show? I&#xA;await your orders. Give me the word and&#xA;test my prowess.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama gently pacified Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;rage which was flaming up into aconflagration. &amp;ldquo;As long as our parents are&#xA;alive,&amp;rdquo; said Rama, &amp;ldquo;it is our duty to obey&#xA;them. I cannot dream of disobeying my&#xA;father. It is our prime duty to do his&#xA;bidding and enable him to fulfil his&#xA;pledge. What joy is there in getting a&#xA;kingship after insulting our parents and&#xA;slaying Bharata, the embodiment of&#xA;dharma?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he wiped with his hand the tears&#xA;from Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s eyes. When Rama did&#xA;this, Lakshmana grew calm for the&#xA;affectionate magic of Rama&amp;rsquo;s hand could&#xA;work wonders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What took place in the inner&#xA;apartments of the palace was not yet&#xA;known to the town-people. But Rama for&#xA;his part lost no time in preparing for forest&#xA;life.&#xA;He went to Queen Kausalya to receive&#xA;her blessings before leaving the city.&#xA;Kausalya said to him again: &amp;ldquo;How can I&#xA;stay in Ayodhya after you are gone? It is&#xA;best that I go with you to the forest.&amp;rdquo; Of&#xA;course, she knew that her duty was to&#xA;serve her husband in his old age and share&#xA;his sorrow in Ayodhya. And yet her mind&#xA;was now so confused by grief that she did&#xA;not see things clearly.&#xA;But Rama would not hear of it and put&#xA;her in mind of her duty to be with the&#xA;heart-stricken old King in his sad solitude.&#xA;She recognised the justice of this&#xA;counsel. She gave him her benedictions in&#xA;sweet words diluted with the salt of&#xA;broken tears. &amp;ldquo;Do as your father has&#xA;decreed and return in glory.&amp;rdquo; Rama put&#xA;heart in her with a smile saying: &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;fourteen years will pass quickly and you&#xA;will see me back.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The poet says that, as Rama received&#xA;his mother&amp;rsquo;s benedictions, his bright face&#xA;glowed with added effulgence. How truly&#xA;he pictures the sublime loveliness that&#xA;comes of a great renunciation that&#xA;illumines one&amp;rsquo;s being as with an Inner&#xA;Light!&#xA;We saw that Rama left Sita and went to&#xA;the King in answer to the message brought&#xA;by Sumantra. Sita was expecting Rama to&#xA;return in a chariot with the royal umbrella,&#xA;followed by a great retinue. But now she&#xA;saw Rama return alone, unattended, with&#xA;none of the royal insignia. And she noted&#xA;on his face the glow of some fixed&#xA;resolve. Rama was thinking as he came&#xA;how he could break to his beloved the&#xA;news that his father had decreed that he&#xA;was to go to forest.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Something troubles the mind of my&#xA;lord,&amp;rdquo; thought Sita, &amp;ldquo;but what can&#xA;anything matter so long as there is our&#xA;love?&amp;rdquo; And she asked him: &amp;ldquo;What is the&#xA;matter? Why do you look so strangely?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama told the story briefly and then&#xA;added: &amp;ldquo;Princess, my love, I can well&#xA;imagine your sorrow at having to part&#xA;from me and stay here. Janaka&amp;rsquo;s daughter&#xA;requires not my guidance to her duty. Be&#xA;thoughtful of the comfort of the King and&#xA;the three Queens, your mothers. Do not&#xA;expect any better treatment than that given&#xA;to the other princesses in the palace. Be&#xA;respectful to Bharata who will be ruler&#xA;and guard against any offence to his&#xA;feelings. Your love for me, I trust, will not&#xA;grow any less during this absence. I shall&#xA;return from forest after these fourteen&#xA;years. Till then do not neglect customary&#xA;rites and ceremonies. Mother Kausalya in&#xA;her sorrow will need your attentive care.&#xA;Bharata and Satrughna are dear to me.&#xA;You will look upon them as your brothers.&#xA;Conduct yourself as befits your royal race&#xA;and your own nature. Avoid extolling me&#xA;so as to give possible offence to other&#xA;good men. I must go to the forest today.&#xA;Keep your mind steady and calm.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Sita heard this unexpected&#xA;speech, her love for Rama manifested&#xA;itself as anger that he should for a momentconceive that she could consent to part&#xA;from him and live in comfort in the palace&#xA;while he was a homeless wanderer in&#xA;pathless forests. &amp;ldquo;A fine speech you have&#xA;made, knower of dharma. It is to me a&#xA;strange doctrine that a wife is diverse&#xA;from her husband and that his duty is not&#xA;hers, and that she has no right to share in&#xA;it. I can never accept it. I hold that your&#xA;fortunes are mine, and if Rama has to go&#xA;to the forest, the command includes Sita&#xA;also, who is a part of him. I shall walk in&#xA;front of you in the forest ways and tread&#xA;the thorns and the hard ground to make&#xA;them smooth for your feet. Do not think&#xA;me obstinate. My father and mother have&#xA;instructed me in dharma. What you tell&#xA;me is totally opposed to what they have&#xA;taught me. To go with you wherever you&#xA;go, that is my only course. If you must go&#xA;to the forest today, then today I go with&#xA;you. There is no room here for any&#xA;discussion. Do not think that I cannot bear&#xA;forest life. With you by my side it will be&#xA;a joyous holiday. I shall not be a source of&#xA;trouble to you. I shall eat fruit and roots&#xA;like you and I shall not lag behind as we&#xA;walk. I have long wished to go to the&#xA;woods with you and rejoice in the sight of&#xA;great mountains and rivers. I shall spend&#xA;the time most happily among the birds and&#xA;flowers, bathing in the rivers and doing&#xA;the daily rites. Away from you, I do not&#xA;care for Heaven itself. I shall surely die if&#xA;you leave me behind. I implore you to&#xA;take me with you. Have pity on me. Do&#xA;not forsake me now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Beginning in anger, her speech ended&#xA;in sobs. Rama explained to Sita that life in&#xA;the forest was not as easy as she thought&#xA;and set out at great length the difficulties&#xA;and dangers and again insisted that she&#xA;should not think of accompanying him.&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. &amp;ldquo;Tigers,&#xA;lions, bears, snakes none of them will&#xA;come near me. They will flee from us at&#xA;the sight of you. The sun, rain, wind and&#xA;hunger and the spikes and thorny shrubs&#xA;you speak of, I shall endure them all&#xA;cheerfully. I am not in the least afraid, and&#xA;on the other hand you may be certain life&#xA;will depart from this body if you leave me&#xA;here and go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;When I was in Mithila,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;the&#xA;Brahmanas and astrologers told my&#xA;mother that I was destined to live in the&#xA;forest for a while. Can I fulfil this&#xA;prediction alone in the forest? Here is the&#xA;opportunity for me to fulfil it in your&#xA;company which will make the forest a&#xA;garden of delight. For whom is forest life&#xA;unpleasant? Only to those men and&#xA;women who have not controlled their&#xA;senses. You and I can be masters of our&#xA;senses and miss nothing. I implore you,&#xA;put me not away from you, for parting&#xA;from you is more cruel than death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There is a strength in supreme love&#xA;which defies reason and laughs at death&#xA;itself. And Rama suffered himself to be&#xA;persuaded, partly because his love was&#xA;great as hers and every passionate word&#xA;she spoke found ready lodgment in his&#xA;heart, and partly because he was confident&#xA;of his ability to protect her. It was settled&#xA;that Sita should accompany Rama to the&#xA;forest.&#xA;She sent for the poor and gave away all&#xA;her belongings and prepared herself for&#xA;life in the forest. Lakshmana also decided&#xA;to go with his brother and be of service to&#xA;him in the forest, and Rama had to agree.&#xA;The three went to take leave of the aged&#xA;King.&#xA;In the streets and on the balconies were&#xA;crowds of people looking on. Through the&#xA;windows and from the terraces of&#xA;mansions, men and women saw Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana and the princess proceeding&#xA;on foot, like the poorest in the land.&#xA;Filled with boundless grief and&#xA;indignation, the people said to oneanother: &amp;ldquo;What kind of a King is this who&#xA;sends so noble a prince to the forest? And&#xA;their Sita walks a princess that should&#xA;command the service of the royal chariot.&#xA;Can she bear the heat and the rain of the&#xA;forest? This is monstrous! We shall go&#xA;then to the forest too. Let us gather up all&#xA;we have and get away to the forest with&#xA;these princes. The forest where Rama&#xA;dwells shall be our Ayodhya. Let these&#xA;houses here henceforth deserted be&#xA;infested with snakes and rats. Let Kaikeyi&#xA;rule over the ruins of Ayodhya. Wild&#xA;beasts and vultures of the forest will come&#xA;to stay here. This will become a forest,&#xA;and the forest will become Ayodhya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama heard people talking thus, but&#xA;took no notice. At the entrance to&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s palace, Rama saw Sumantra&#xA;seated sorrow fully aside in a corner.&#xA;Rama tenderly spoke to him: &amp;ldquo;The three of&#xA;us have come to meet the King. Sumantra,&#xA;crave leave for us to enter his presence.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sumantra went, in accordingly to&#xA;announce them to the King. What a sight&#xA;met him there! Like the sun in eclipse,&#xA;like an oven filled all over with ash, like a&#xA;tank gone dry, the King was stretched flat&#xA;on the floor, his glory gone and his face&#xA;shrunken and distorted with anguish.&#xA;Sumantra, his voice trembling with&#xA;grief and his hands clasped together, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The Prince waits at the entrance and&#xA;seeks audience to take your blessings&#xA;before he gives away all he has to the&#xA;Brahmanas and starts for the Dandaka&#xA;forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King bade Sumantra let the Prince&#xA;in.&#xA;Rama came and bowed to the King&#xA;from a distance. As soon as he saw Rama,&#xA;the King suddenly rose and rushed with&#xA;out stretched arms to embrace him, but&#xA;dropped in a swoon before reaching his&#xA;son.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana tenderly lifted&#xA;him up and put him on the couch. &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;Lord,&amp;rdquo; said Rama, &amp;ldquo;we have come to seek&#xA;your leave to go to I the forest. Vaidehi&#xA;and Lakshmana too are going with me in&#xA;spite of all I could do to make them desist.&#xA;Pray give us your benedictions and leave&#xA;to depart.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha then said: &amp;ldquo;Rama, I am&#xA;bound by the boons that I have given to&#xA;Kaikeyi. But you are not so bound. Why&#xA;do you not brush me aside and seize the&#xA;kingdom by force?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;That had long been in the King&amp;rsquo;s mind&#xA;as the best and only solution of this cruel&#xA;problem and came out now clearly in&#xA;words.&#xA;But Rama said: &amp;ldquo;I have no desire for&#xA;kingdom or power, father. May you reign&#xA;for a thousand years more. My heart is&#xA;now set on going to the forest and I am&#xA;even now in readiness to start after&#xA;receiving your blessing. When the&#xA;fourteen years have passed I shall return&#xA;and tender obeisance.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The King&amp;rsquo;s faint hope, it was now&#xA;clear, must be abandoned. &amp;ldquo;My son! Bring&#xA;glory to our line of kings. Go, but come&#xA;back unscathed. May danger flee from&#xA;your path. Cling to dharma. You are&#xA;unshakable in resolution. Firm and&#xA;unchangeable is your will. But do not go&#xA;away today. Spend but this night here&#xA;with me. Let me fill my eyes with the&#xA;sight of you. You can go away at dawn.&#xA;Like one handling a live coal deceptively&#xA;covered with ash, I gave the promise to&#xA;Kaikeyi not knowing what was in her&#xA;mind. I am now helpless and caught in her&#xA;net. And you say, &amp;lsquo;I shall fulfil my father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;promise. I shall not let dishonor blot the&#xA;name of my father. I shall give up the&#xA;kingdom and go to the forest.&amp;rsquo; Where in&#xA;the world can one find a son like unto&#xA;you? I swear to you, I did not intend this&#xA;great wrong.&amp;ldquo;Thus piteously spoke the King. It was&#xA;Dasharatha&amp;rsquo;s wish to die without losing,&#xA;even in his last moments, the respect of&#xA;Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Father, send for Bharata at once and&#xA;fulfil the promise you have given to&#xA;mother Kaikeyi. Do not be troubled by the&#xA;thought that you are doing me a wrong,&#xA;for I had no desire for the throne, and do&#xA;not feel it a deprivation to be denied it.&#xA;Untroubled by grief or doubt, have&#xA;Bharata crowned and give him your&#xA;blessings. Cast all grief aside. Shed no&#xA;tears. Can the ocean dry up? So may you&#xA;too not lose your balance ever, great&#xA;father. My sole wish is to make good the&#xA;word you gave. If I got all the wealth of&#xA;the world, but falsify your word, what joy&#xA;would that be to me? I shall spend my&#xA;time happily in the forest. Where but in&#xA;the forests can one find beauty or joy?&#xA;Father, you are my God. I take it that it is&#xA;God that sends me to the forest. When the&#xA;fourteen years are over, you will see me&#xA;again. Do not grieve. What profits it that I&#xA;stay here a night longer and go tomorrow?&#xA;Time is made up of a succession of&#xA;tomorrows and one day is just like&#xA;another. Inevitable sorrows do not become&#xA;joys by postponement.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Well then, send for the commanders,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said the King to Sumantra, &amp;ldquo;and order&#xA;them to get ready the chariots, elephants,&#xA;horses and foot soldiers, to go with Rama&#xA;to the forest. And along with the army&#xA;send all the necessary stores for Rama to&#xA;live with the Rishis of the forest. Let there&#xA;be nothing wanting in men, money or&#xA;things.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Poor Dasaratha imagined that he could&#xA;make Rama&amp;rsquo;s exile to the forest something&#xA;like a royal tour affording a pleasant&#xA;change from routine and enlivened by&#xA;exchange of gracious hospitalities with the&#xA;sylvan population.&#xA;As he spoke Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s face paled with&#xA;anger. She glowered at the King, and in a&#xA;voice tremulous with scornful wrath she&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;A good and generous monarch surely!&#xA;You will give Bharata this kingdom after&#xA;squeezing out of it all the good it holds, as&#xA;one might offer in mockery an empty&#xA;drinking vessel to a man dying of thirst!&#xA;What pleasure or glory will my son have&#xA;in ruling a deserted state?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dasaratha groaned in helpless chagrin&#xA;and marveled at a cruelty that could stab a&#xA;man already crushed under an intolerable&#xA;burden. Angry words rose from the&#xA;mouths of those around, for even the&#xA;courtiers found this open heartlessness&#xA;more than they could suffer in silence.&#xA;Rama put an end to all recriminations by&#xA;saying he would not agree to take&#xA;paraphernalia incongruous with what was&#xA;intended in forest life.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Honored Lord,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;what use&#xA;have I, who am departing to the forest to&#xA;live on what sylvan nature yields, for an&#xA;army or the glittering equipage of a royal&#xA;pageant? After gladly renouncing the&#xA;throne, what use have I for its restrains?&#xA;Would it not be covetous folly, after&#xA;having parted with the elephant, to burden&#xA;oneself with the ponderous chain? Father,&#xA;I have cheerfully relinquished my claim to&#xA;the kingdom in favor of Bharata and his&#xA;mother, and with it all the incidents of&#xA;royalty. For my fourteen years of forest&#xA;life I require nothing but bark garments&#xA;such as Rishis wear and simple&#xA;necessaries of forest life such as spades&#xA;and baskets.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hardly had Rama spoken these words&#xA;when the unabashed Kaikeyi hastened to&#xA;produce the forest dress! She had kept it&#xA;ready and gave it herself without a blush&#xA;to Rama. Then and there Rama dressed&#xA;himself in bark. And in these garments be&#xA;shone like a Rishi. Lakshmana toochanged into bark dress, while Dasaratha&#xA;watched all this in helpless anguish.&#xA;Then Kaikeyi brought a bark dress for&#xA;Sita too. She received it and stood&#xA;bewildered, for she had never worn such&#xA;garments before and did not know how to&#xA;change into them.&#xA;Approaching Rama, who stood there&#xA;resplendent with divine effulgence, Sita&#xA;said shyly: &amp;ldquo;Pray tell me, how does one&#xA;put this thing on?&amp;rdquo; As Rama took up the&#xA;bark dress and, wrapping it over Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;silk, made a knot over her shoulder, the&#xA;ladies-in-waiting&#xA;wailed&#xA;aloud&#xA;and&#xA;Dasaratha fell into a swoon.&#xA;When he regained consciousness, he&#xA;loudly reviled Kaikeyi, but she only&#xA;smiled scornfully. She surely was not&#xA;responsible for Sita going to the forest.&#xA;The princess sought her own pleasure by&#xA;going to the forest with her husband and&#xA;would not be dissuaded.&#xA;Lowering his eyes as he was leaving,&#xA;Rama said: &amp;ldquo;Father, I leave behind my&#xA;mother Kausalya, blameless and tender-&#xA;hearted lady, bereft of her son in her old&#xA;age. This sudden fate is bitter to her as&#xA;death, but she consents to live only for&#xA;your sake, to share your sorrow and&#xA;console you. She is incapable of harboring&#xA;an unkind thought towards anyone, and&#xA;she has never before felt the pang of such&#xA;poignant parting. Be kind to her when I&#xA;am no longer here and, when I return after&#xA;my long exile in the hope of putting my&#xA;head on her feet, let me not hear that she&#xA;has died of sorrow.&amp;rdquo; Thus Rama spoke,&#xA;unable to bear the thought of his mother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;grief. As Rama went out speaking thus,&#xA;Dasaratha could not endure the sight and&#xA;covered his face with his hands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER Rama left his father&amp;rsquo;s presence&#xA;with these words, the stricken King lay&#xA;prostrated in speechless sorrow, and it was&#xA;some time before he could muster his&#xA;faculties sufficiently even to think.&#xA;When he recovered some strength, he&#xA;muttered half unconsciously: &amp;ldquo;Surely I&#xA;must in a previous birth have inflicted&#xA;hideous suffering to loving hearts. I must&#xA;have torn calves from their mothers,&#xA;children from their parents, husbands&#xA;from their wives. How else could I suffer&#xA;thus? And death does not come when we&#xA;want it. And I have to endure the torture&#xA;of always having before my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye&#xA;my godlike son deprived of his birthright&#xA;and forced into the bark-garments of a&#xA;hermit. O life, how bitterly you cling to&#xA;those who would be rid of you! Rama has&#xA;gone into exile and yet I do not die! Rama&#xA;&amp;hellip; Rama &amp;hellip; Have you gone? &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A little later, his mind clearer, the King&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Sumantra, get ready the chariot and&#xA;take my sons and Janaki to the frontier of&#xA;the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana touched the feet of his&#xA;mother Sumitra and uttered the single&#xA;word &amp;ldquo;Mother.&amp;rdquo; She embraced him, kissed&#xA;his head and said: &amp;ldquo;Your devotion to your&#xA;brother has filled your mother&amp;rsquo;s heart with&#xA;pride and joy. It is your duty, child, to&#xA;guard and serve Rama. Always stand in&#xA;vigilant watch by Rama&amp;rsquo;s side in the&#xA;forest. Your elder brother is to you both&#xA;preceptor and king. This is the dharma of&#xA;our race. Go with my blessing,&#xA;Lakshmana. In the forest, regard Rama as&#xA;your father and look upon Janaki as&#xA;myself and the forest will be to you as&#xA;Ayodhya. Go cheerfully, my dear son, and&#xA;God bless you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the Ramayana, Sumitra is a woman&#xA;of few words and mature wisdom and&#xA;great tact and infinite courage, full of&#xA;faith, in whom &amp;lsquo;hope shines like a fame&#xA;when it has gone out in all others.&amp;rsquo; The&#xA;tradition is that Sumitra knew Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;divinity and the purpose of his incarnation&#xA;and that this enabled her not only tocomfort Kausalya but to see a holy&#xA;ministration&#xA;in&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;sharing&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s exile.&#xA;Sumitra said: &amp;ldquo;Ascend the chariot, O&#xA;Prince. God blesses you. Tell me where I&#xA;am to drive, for the fourteen-year period&#xA;has begun, my Prince.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita got up the chariot cheerfully.&#xA;Kausalya had made up for her a packet of&#xA;personal requirements. The shields, bows&#xA;and arrows and other weapons of the two&#xA;brothers together with pickaxes and&#xA;baskets were placed in the chariot.&#xA;Pickaxes and baskets are essential in the&#xA;forest. Rama and Lakshmana ascended the&#xA;chariot. Sumantra drove it forward.&#xA;Let us pause a while at this stage when&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s forest life begins, and pray that we&#xA;may be purified of our sins. Truth,&#xA;courage and love are the gospel of the&#xA;Ramayana to us. To give it to us was&#xA;Rama born. We shall gain these gifts if we&#xA;meditate on the Princes and Janaki in the&#xA;bark habiliment as they left the city.&#xA;The crowds in the street cried to the&#xA;charioteer: &amp;ldquo;Go slow, go slow. Let us have&#xA;a look at Rama&amp;rsquo;s face. Alas, Alas, who&#xA;could send such children to the forest?&#xA;How could their mothers endure this&#xA;sorrow and survive? Look at Vaidehi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;face. She is indeed blessed. And&#xA;Lakshmana is happy to have such a&#xA;brother to whom he can give devoted&#xA;service. He is indeed a hero and a knower&#xA;of dharma.&amp;rdquo; So the people of the city&#xA;talked among themselves as they followed&#xA;the chariot. And their grief swelled like a&#xA;flood.&#xA;Rama was saying to the good&#xA;charioteer, &amp;ldquo;Faster, faster&amp;rdquo; The people&#xA;were saying, &amp;ldquo;slow, slow.&amp;rdquo; And the crowd&#xA;became bigger and bigger. Sumantra&#xA;managed somehow to take the chariot out&#xA;of the press of the mourning town where,&#xA;in addition to the loud sorrow of the&#xA;crowded streets, the houses were full of&#xA;mourning women and children.&#xA;The King stepped out of Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;apartment and looked at the departing&#xA;chariot. A long time he stood there&#xA;watching the cloud of dust as though he&#xA;saw in it the beloved form of Rama. When&#xA;even this went out of sight, he fell down,&#xA;moaning. Kausalya and Kaikeyi sat on&#xA;either side.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not touch me,&amp;rdquo; said Dasaratha to&#xA;Kaikeyi. &amp;ldquo;I hate the sight of you, sinful&#xA;woman! Everything is at an end between&#xA;you and me. I renounce you here and&#xA;now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If&#xA;Bharata&#xA;agrees&#xA;to&#xA;your&#xA;arrangements and accepts the kingdom,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said again, &amp;ldquo;he need not perform my&#xA;obsequies, and even if he did, my departed&#xA;spirit would reject his offering of waters.&#xA;How can Rama live in the forest? Will he&#xA;sleep on the bare ground with a stone or a&#xA;log for a pillow? Will he eat fruits and&#xA;berries?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus the king went on lamenting&#xA;helplessly.&#xA;Sometimes he would turn to Kaikeyi&#xA;and say, &amp;ldquo;May you be happy in your&#xA;success! Long may you live a happy&#xA;widow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Heart-broken and empty like one&#xA;returning home from the cremation&#xA;ground, he entered Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s apartment by&#xA;force of habit; then suddenly he said, &amp;ldquo;Not&#xA;here. Take me to the dwelling of&#xA;Kausalya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so they did, and there he lay&#xA;waiting for his end.&#xA;At midnight, he said, &amp;ldquo;Kausalya, are&#xA;you there? Touch me with your hand. My&#xA;sight is gone with Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Poor Kausalya did her best to comfort&#xA;the King, but what comfort was there in&#xA;her wounded heart to give? For as the&#xA;slow sorrow-laden hours crawled from&#xA;watch to watch, the cold night seemed toher a devouring flame, and the gentle&#xA;moon fierce as the noonday sun.&#xA;To her thus sorrowing Sumitra said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sister, you have heard the Shastras and&#xA;know dharma. Why should you grieve like&#xA;this? It is your office to put courage in&#xA;others, you should not lose heart yourself.&#xA;Rama has gone to the forest for guarding&#xA;the King&amp;rsquo;s honor. You are indeed blessed&#xA;among women, for you are the mother of&#xA;a hero who has scorned a kingdom and&#xA;preferred to uphold his father&amp;rsquo;s honor.&#xA;Why should you grieve for a son who&#xA;fulfils a difficult duty to perfection? We&#xA;should not feel sorry for one who walks in&#xA;the path of his ancestors and wins undying&#xA;fame. I am proud that Lakshmana has&#xA;accompanied Rama. Janaki, though&#xA;knowing well the hardships she has to&#xA;face, has also gone with her husband.&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s glory will shine like an undying&#xA;lamp. This is no occasion for grief. His&#xA;purity, his virtue shall be a shield and&#xA;armor to them. He is so great and holy&#xA;that the sunrays falling on him will not&#xA;burn him and the wind that blows will&#xA;caress him with its coolness. His pure&#xA;frame, as he sleeps at night, will be&#xA;embraced and protected by the moon-&#xA;beams as an infant is by its loving mother.&#xA;Shed all anxiety over your heroic son. No&#xA;foe can en counter him and escape with&#xA;life. Our Rama is endowed with all&#xA;auspicious qualities. Your hero son will&#xA;surely return to Ayodhya and ascend the&#xA;throne. The Lord of the world, and no&#xA;other, is Rama. Sita is with him, and Sita&#xA;is no other than the Goddess Lakshmi.&#xA;Rama will return and ascending the throne&#xA;will fill with delight the kingdom which&#xA;now laments his exile. You saw the grief&#xA;of the citizens as they watched his&#xA;departure. My heroic son, the devoted&#xA;Lakshmana, armed with bow and sword,&#xA;has gone with him to guard his person. No&#xA;harm, no danger can approach Rama. You&#xA;will see with your own eyes Rama&#xA;returning after fulfilment of his vow.&#xA;Believe me, Rama will return, beautiful&#xA;like the full moon, and touch your feet&#xA;with joy and devotion. You will then shed&#xA;tears not of grief but of joy. Dear, dear&#xA;Kausalya, give up your grief. You will see&#xA;the three of them returning. You should&#xA;console and encourage the other women&#xA;in the palace and not stand broken-hearted&#xA;yourself. Who else in this world stands&#xA;firm by dharma like Rama? Is this a cause&#xA;for grief? No, be proud of your son,&#xA;Kausalya!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to Sumitra&amp;rsquo;s words, Kausalya&#xA;was somewhat consoled.&#xA;The people of the city followed Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chariot in a huge crowd. They tried to stop&#xA;the chariot, shouting, &amp;ldquo;Do not go to the&#xA;forest. Return to the city.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am going to the forest to uphold my&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s, word,&amp;rdquo; Rama said. &amp;ldquo;There is no&#xA;time for sorrow here and you should not&#xA;seek to hinder me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But the people would not listen to him,&#xA;and went in crowds after him shouting&#xA;wildly: &amp;ldquo;Do not go to the forest, do not go&#xA;to the forest!&amp;rdquo; Rama stopped the chariot&#xA;and addressed them with his eyes full of&#xA;love for them: &amp;ldquo;Citizens of Ayodhya, I&#xA;know the love you bear for me. You will&#xA;show it best by transferring it on my&#xA;behalf, and at my behest, to my beloved&#xA;brother Bharata. Nothing else will please&#xA;me more. Bharata is good and noble, has&#xA;all royal qualities and is fully worthy of&#xA;love. So conduct yourselves as to please&#xA;him. Young in years, he is old in wisdom&#xA;and his heart is at once heroic and tender.&#xA;He has the strength to protect you. He is&#xA;your king, and you owe him loyalty and&#xA;affection. I am going to the forest to fulfil&#xA;my father word and the King has&#xA;appointed Bharata as Yuvaraja. He is in&#xA;every way fitted for that position. You and&#xA;I alike should obey the King&amp;rsquo;s commands.You should go back and try to mitigate&#xA;the sorrow of my father at parting from&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Rama spoke to them in kindly&#xA;tones. But they loved him all the more&#xA;because of this and would not be&#xA;consoled. Some Brahmanas, old in years&#xA;and excellent in virtue, looking at the&#xA;chariot wept and cried: &amp;ldquo;Why, O horses,&#xA;do you carry our Rama into the forest?&#xA;We have heard it said that horses are&#xA;sharp of hearing. Listen to us then and&#xA;bring back our Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these words of yearning from&#xA;old Brahmanas, Rama stopped the chariot.&#xA;The three descended from it and went&#xA;forward walking.&#xA;The common people, leading citizens&#xA;and wise elders, men of penance, why,&#xA;even the birds on wings, tried to prevent&#xA;Rama from going to the forest. The river&#xA;Tamasa, says the poet, seemed to conspire&#xA;with them, for now it flowed across his&#xA;path. The chariot stopped on the&#xA;riverbank. Sumantra unyoked and watered&#xA;the horses and let them loose to graze.&#xA;Rama said: &amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, this is the&#xA;first night of our forest i l fe. Let us spend it&#xA;on the bank of this holy river. Life in the&#xA;forest holds no hardship, as you and I&#xA;know. Look, the birds, the animals and&#xA;even the trees seem to sympathise with us.&#xA;The only pain is when we think of the&#xA;grief of our parents in Ayodhya, though I&#xA;feel reassured as I think of Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;nobility and goodness. He will assuredly&#xA;tend our parents with true affection.&#xA;Sumantra, go, look after the horses.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then, Rama offered the evening&#xA;prayers by the river and said: &amp;ldquo;Let us fast&#xA;on this first night of our forest life,&#xA;Lakshmana. Your presence by my side&#xA;rids me of all care.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana spread some grass on the&#xA;ground for Rama and Sita to sleep on but&#xA;he himself spent the night in vigil talking&#xA;with Sumantra.&#xA;Long before dawn Rama rose from&#xA;sleep and told Sumantra: &amp;ldquo;The citizens&#xA;who have followed us, fatigued by their&#xA;long journey, are fast asleep. I am deeply&#xA;moved by their affection; but I cannot&#xA;permit their love to force me to go back.&#xA;Let us therefore, move on even now,&#xA;while they are yet asleep.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The horses were harnessed and the&#xA;chariot slowly crossed the river. Standing&#xA;on the southern bank, Rama told&#xA;Sumantra:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you take the chariot to the other&#xA;shore, where the people are asleep, and&#xA;drive it for a little distance towards&#xA;Ayodhya and then bring it back to this&#xA;side, we can proceed on our journey&#xA;before they wake up. They will see the&#xA;track of the chariot going towards the city,&#xA;and thinking that we have returned home,&#xA;may themselves go back. Unless you do&#xA;this the crowd will go on following us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sumantra did this and, when the&#xA;chariot returned, the three got into it again&#xA;and proceeded southwards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The citizens who had slept on the bank&#xA;of the Tamasa woke up in the morning&#xA;and looked round. They were surprised to&#xA;see that Rama and the chariot had&#xA;disappeared. They followed the track of&#xA;the chariot-wheels but were disappointed&#xA;to find that it was lost in the main road to&#xA;the capital.&#xA;They returned home to their own&#xA;houses and sought satisfaction in reviling&#xA;Kaikeyi. Without Rama, the city was&#xA;bereft of beauty and wrapt in gloom.&#xA;Sumantra and the princes had crossed&#xA;the Tamasa long before dawn and&#xA;travelled far into the forest. Crossing&#xA;several streams, they approached the&#xA;southern boundary of the Kosala country.&#xA;As they journeyed on, Rama said toSumantra: &amp;ldquo;I wonder when I shall hunt&#xA;again in the forest of Sarayu. Is hunting&#xA;good for princes? Perhaps, it is, in&#xA;moderation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus conversing on many matters, they&#xA;went forward. When they reached the&#xA;southern boundary of the kingdom, Rama&#xA;stopped the chariot and facing north&#xA;towards Ayodhya, bent his head in a&#xA;prayer, saying: &amp;ldquo;O, jewel among cities! O&#xA;ancient capital of the Ikshwakus! Shall I&#xA;finishing my penance in the forest, live to&#xA;see my father and mother and you? Grant&#xA;me that supreme joy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The chariot reached the bank of the&#xA;Ganga. They proceeded along the bank,&#xA;admiring the beauty of the river. Finding a&#xA;spot of surpassing charm, Rama said: &amp;ldquo;We&#xA;shall spend the night here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Untying the horses, they sat under a&#xA;tree. Guha, the chief of the region, having&#xA;learnt already from his men that Rama&#xA;would be coming there, came forward&#xA;with his retinue to greet Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana.&#xA;He had unbounded love for the royal&#xA;family and for Rama. Being the chieftain&#xA;of the tribes who dwelt on the banks of&#xA;Ganga, he was a man of great prestige and&#xA;power. Rama and Lakshmana rose to greet&#xA;Guha, even while the latter was still at&#xA;some&#xA;distance&#xA;from&#xA;them.&#xA;Guha&#xA;welcomed them with a hearty embrace,&#xA;saying: &amp;ldquo;Regard this land as your own.&#xA;This place is as much yours as is&#xA;Ayodhya. Who can hope to have a guest&#xA;like you? It is indeed my good fortune.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Guha&#xA;had&#xA;prepared&#xA;a&#xA;lavish&#xA;entertainment. He said, &amp;ldquo;Feel perfectly at&#xA;home and happy in my kingdom. You&#xA;may spend all the fourteen years with us&#xA;here. You will not lack anything I assure&#xA;you. Looking after you will be a pleasure&#xA;and privilege to me. Be gracious enough&#xA;to accept my hospitality.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Warmly embracing Guha again, Rama&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Brother, I know how deep is your&#xA;love for me. Your wish is itself as good as&#xA;hospitality rendered. I am bound by my&#xA;vows and must refuse anything more. I&#xA;have come to dwell in the forest and not to&#xA;enjoy life as a chieftain&amp;rsquo;s guest. These&#xA;horses are my dear father&amp;rsquo;s favorites. Pray&#xA;feed them well. We shall be content with&#xA;simple food and rest for the night.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They lay under the tree for the night.&#xA;Guha and Lakshmana kept awake,&#xA;conversing with Sumantra.&#xA;Said Guha to Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;Brother, do&#xA;go and rest. There is a bed made ready for&#xA;you. My men will keep careful watch.&#xA;None dare do anything in the forest&#xA;unknown to me. Have no anxiety&#xA;regarding Rama. Do sleep.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana replied: &amp;ldquo;How can I find&#xA;sleep, Guha? Here, lying on the bare&#xA;ground, is Sita, daughter of the great&#xA;Janaka and daughter-in-law of the great&#xA;Dasaratha.&#xA;The&#xA;great&#xA;Purushottama&#xA;himself who could subdue the three&#xA;worlds lies stretched on the grass. How&#xA;can I sleep who sees this? I wonder how&#xA;Ayodhya is bearing it. He queens&#39;&#xA;apartments must be loud with wailing. I&#xA;even doubt if at this moment Kausalya&#xA;and my mother are alive. My father&#xA;indeed found strength somehow to say to&#xA;Rama, &amp;lsquo;Go to the forest,&amp;rsquo; but I doubt if he&#xA;has strength enough left to survive Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;actual departure. And if he has passed&#xA;away, our mothers too will have given up&#xA;their lives. And here we are, deprived&#xA;even of the privilege of doing the last&#xA;offices to the dead. In any case it is hardly&#xA;possible that our father and mothers will&#xA;be alive to greet us, when we return to&#xA;Ayodhya after our term in the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus spoke Lakshmana in sorrow.&#xA;Guha was in tears. The night was spent in&#xA;such sad conversation.Early next morning, Rama told&#xA;Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;We must now cross the&#xA;river. Ask Guha to make ready a boat big&#xA;enough for crossing this broad river.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Guha ordered his men to get this done and&#xA;informed Rama.&#xA;Sumantra bowed low and stood before&#xA;Rama seeking his further commands.&#xA;Rama understood Sumantra&amp;rsquo;s unuttered&#xA;grief and, laying his hand on Sumantra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;shoulders, said: &amp;ldquo;Sumantra, return to&#xA;Ayodhya with all speed and be at the side&#xA;of the King. Your duty is now to look&#xA;after him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Rama,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Sumantra,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;rectitude, learning and culture seem to be&#xA;of no value. You and your brother and&#xA;Vaidehi are going to live in the forest.&#xA;What is going to be our lot? How are we&#xA;going to fare under Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s rule?&amp;rdquo; He&#xA;now wept like a child.&#xA;Wiping the tears from Sumantra&amp;rsquo;s eyes,&#xA;Rama said: &amp;ldquo;Our family has known no&#xA;nobler friend than you. It will be your task&#xA;to console my father. His heart is river by&#xA;grief. Whatever his commands carry them&#xA;out dutifully. Do not ask yourself whether&#xA;he wants a thing for himself or with a&#xA;view to pleasing Kaikeyi. Avoid giving&#xA;him any pain of mind. Have no anxiety&#xA;about us. You should say this on my&#xA;behalf to my aged father who is stricken&#xA;with a grief he never knew before. Clasp&#xA;his feet as you have seen me do, and&#xA;assure him from me that none of us, not I&#xA;nor Lakshmana, nor Sita, feel injured or&#xA;sorry at having been sent away from&#xA;Ayodhya. We look forward to fourteen&#xA;years of forest life which will speed on&#xA;happy wings, and then surely we shall&#xA;return to his feet for blessings. Give our&#xA;love to my mother Kausalya, and tell her&#xA;that protected by her blessings we are well&#xA;and give a like message to my&#xA;stepmothers, especially to Kaikeyi, lest&#xA;she should think we have parted in anger.&#xA;Tell the Maharaja that it is my earnest&#xA;prayer that he should hasten with the&#xA;installation of Bharata, so that he may be a&#xA;comfort to him in our absence.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Sumantra, unable to restrain his&#xA;grief, burst out: &amp;ldquo;How am I to return and&#xA;with what words can I give comfort?&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;when he looked at the empty chariot, he&#xA;wept and said: &amp;ldquo;How shall I drive this&#xA;chariot that stands desolate without you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Once again Rama spoke words of&#xA;comfort and courage to Sumantra and&#xA;urged on him the duty of patience, and&#xA;sent him home.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Guha&amp;rdquo;, said Rama, &amp;ldquo;I could indeed&#xA;spend fourteen years in your kingdom as&#xA;you desire. But would that be fulfilling&#xA;my vow? I have left Ayodhya to fulfil my&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s pledge. I must therefore lead the&#xA;life of a tapasvi. I must not touch dishes&#xA;daintily cooked and served. We have to&#xA;live only on fruits, roots and permissible&#xA;kinds of meat such as we offer in the&#xA;sacrificial fire.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Comforting Guha thus, the brothers got&#xA;their locks matted with the milk of the&#xA;banyan. They helped Sita into the boat&#xA;and then got into it themselves. Guha bade&#xA;the boatmen to row it across.&#xA;The boatmen took them quickly across&#xA;the river. At midstream Sita offered a&#xA;prayer to the goddess of the river: &amp;ldquo;Devi,&#xA;help us fulfil our vow and return safe to&#xA;our homeland.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They talked as they went on. They&#xA;reached the farther bank of Ganga. And&#xA;there for the first time, the three stood&#xA;alone, unattended by friends!&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, you are my sole armed&#xA;guard now,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. &amp;ldquo;You will go&#xA;first. Sita will follow. And I shall walk&#xA;behind you both. We must save Sita as far&#xA;as possible from the hardships of forest&#xA;life. Hereafter there will be none to keep&#xA;us company and no fun or amusement.&amp;ldquo;Rama&amp;rsquo;s thoughts went to his mother&#xA;Kausalya.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;should you not&#xA;go back to Ayodhya and look after mother&#xA;Kausalya and Sumitra Devi? I shall&#xA;manage my forest stay somehow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana replied: &amp;ldquo;Forgive me,&#xA;brother; I am not going back to Ayodhya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama indeed expected no other answer.&#xA;Thus now and again we shall see the&#xA;human element come up and the divine&#xA;prince grieve and talk as common people&#xA;do. This is the fascination of the&#xA;Ramayana. If Almighty God remains&#xA;almighty and does everything Himself,&#xA;then where is room or need for an avatar&#xA;and how could the dharma of common&#xA;men be established?&#xA;This is the difference between the&#xA;earlier avatars and the later. In the Rama&#xA;avatar, the course of human conduct and&#xA;the dharma governing it come linked&#xA;together. This has been made explicit by&#xA;Valmiki.&#xA;On the occasion of Sita&amp;rsquo;s ordeal by fire&#xA;at the end of the battle, Rama says to&#xA;Brahma who appeared then among others&#xA;and deprecated the idea of putting Sita to&#xA;proof:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I regard myself only as Rama, son of&#xA;Dasaratha, an ordinary human being. Who&#xA;I am in reality, where I belong, why I took&#xA;birth, are matters on which you must&#xA;enlighten me, and I do not know.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While Rama was plunged in thinking&#xA;of the mothers left behind, Lakshmana&#xA;ministered to him with loving words of&#xA;courage and hope.&#xA;They spent that night under a banyan&#xA;tree and left early next morning for&#xA;Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama which they reached&#xA;at sunset.&#xA;Partaking of the hospitality of the sage,&#xA;they besought him to tell where they could&#xA;spend the years quietly in the forest and&#xA;on his advice and with his blessings left&#xA;for Chitrakuta.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rama spent the night in Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;ashrama. Getting up in the morning, they&#xA;paid their respects to the Maharishi and,&#xA;taking leave of him, set out for the&#xA;Chitrakuta hill. The muni treated them&#xA;affectionately as if they were his own&#xA;children and sent them forth with his&#xA;blessings after explaining to them the way&#xA;they should take through the forest.&#xA;The three followed his topographical&#xA;instructions closely and in due course&#xA;came upon the river Kalindi. They&#xA;constructed a raft with logs and bamboos&#xA;and creepers of the forest and on it&#xA;Lakshmana made a seat for Sita with little&#xA;twigs and leaves on which she sat. The&#xA;passage of the river was accomplished in&#xA;safety.&#xA;In midstream Sita offered salutations to&#xA;the river goddess and prayed that Rama&#xA;might fulfil his vow and the three be&#xA;enabled safely to return home.&#xA;After crossing a few more streams,&#xA;they came to a big banyan tree which had&#xA;been described by Bharadwaja. And under&#xA;this tree Sita again offered prayers saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Grant, O holy tree, that my husband may&#xA;complete his vow and that I may see again&#xA;the queens Kausalya and Sumitra.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama asked Lakshmana to walk in&#xA;front with Sita behind him while he&#xA;himself followed in the rear. &amp;ldquo;Whatever,&#xA;flower or fruit she asks for on the way,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said, &amp;ldquo;get it for her and keep her spirits&#xA;up.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Sita went she showed an eager&#xA;curiosity, asking about forest trees and&#xA;creepers and was lost in admiration at the&#xA;many-sided beauty of forest life.&#xA;They greatly enjoyed the journey and&#xA;rested for the night on the bank of a river.&#xA;Here and in other places, Valmiki&#xA;describes how Rama and Lakshmanasecured food by hunting. He makes it&#xA;quite plain that they had to subsist largely&#xA;on meat. Some good men are troubled by&#xA;this. But meat was not prohibited for&#xA;Kshatriyas. Indeed, it has always been the&#xA;rule in India to permit any food&#xA;legitimately obtained and consecrated as a&#xA;sacrifice. Rama was a Kshatriya and he&#xA;lived in the forest in the Kshatriya way,&#xA;though abstemiously.&#xA;The following morning Rama woke up&#xA;Lakshmana and said: &amp;ldquo;Listen, the birds are&#xA;singing to the morning sun. It is time for&#xA;us to start.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The popular story that Lakshmana&#xA;spent the whole period of forest life&#xA;without food or sleep is not found in&#xA;Valmiki.&#xA;Sometimes,&#xA;even,&#xA;through&#xA;fatigue Lakshmana did not get up quite&#xA;early in the morning and Rama had to&#xA;rouse him from slumber!&#xA;They performed their ablutions and&#xA;worship and resumed their journey in the&#xA;path indicated by Bharadwaja. The season&#xA;was summer and the trees and plants were&#xA;ablaze with multi colored flowers. The&#xA;branches bowed under the weight of fruits&#xA;and blossoms.&#xA;Rama pointed out the beauty of the&#xA;forest to Sita from time to then, saying as&#xA;they walked: &amp;ldquo;How beautiful is the forest&#xA;unspoilt by human interference! Look at&#xA;the beehives hanging there! Look at the&#xA;ground entirely covered with fallen&#xA;flowers! Listen to the birds! How&#xA;beautifully they sing to one another and&#xA;live in joy! Life would indeed be pleasant&#xA;if we could always enjoy such sights and&#xA;sounds.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then they saw at a distance the&#xA;Chitrakuta hill. They were glad and began&#xA;to walk briskly towards it. &amp;ldquo;How beautiful&#xA;this region is!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Rama. &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;forest here has fine edible roots and fruits.&#xA;The water is clear and sweet. Rishis dwell&#xA;in ashramas in this forest and we may&#xA;most certainly live happily here in their&#xA;holy company.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They proceeded to put up an ashrama&#xA;there for themselves. Lakshmana was a&#xA;clever workman. He soon constructed a&#xA;strong hut, which was weather-proof and&#xA;made it comfortable and convenient.&#xA;Single-handed, he completed the mud hut&#xA;with windows and doors all made of&#xA;bamboos and jungle material.&#xA;Kamban and Valmiki vie with each&#xA;other in their accounts of this episode.&#xA;Kamban says that when Lakshmana had&#xA;completed the structure, Rama embraced&#xA;him weeping and asked him: &amp;ldquo;When and&#xA;how did you learn all this?&amp;rdquo; One can&#xA;imagine the scene.&#xA;Rama, his eyes filled with tears of joy,&#xA;said, according to Kamban: &amp;ldquo;The flower-&#xA;soft feet of the Princess of Mithila have&#xA;traversed the hard forest floor. If her feet&#xA;have done a wonder, why, Lakshmana,&#xA;your hands too have wrought a miracle of&#xA;house-building! I have seen today the gain&#xA;that is in misfortune.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Here, beside the lovely Chitrakuta hill,&#xA;on the bank of the river Malyavati, in that&#xA;cottage the three young people lived, free&#xA;from care, performing their daily&#xA;devotional routine. They forgot that they&#xA;were in exile and spent the time happily,&#xA;like Indra in Heaven surrounded by the&#xA;gods.&#xA;The happy life in Chitrakuta is a&#xA;wonderful background to set off the later&#xA;sufferings and sorrows of the three.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>21 A MOTHER&#39;S GRIEF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sumantra and Guha stood watching the&#xA;three figures as long as they could. When&#xA;they disappeared from sight, they were&#xA;plunged in sorrow and went back to&#xA;Guha&amp;rsquo;s town. After a while Sumantra&#xA;returned to Ayodhya.&#xA;As the charioteer approached the city,&#xA;he found it desolate and devoid of the&#xA;usual cheerful bustle of urban life. Assoon as he crossed the fortress-gate and&#xA;entered the city, his chariot was&#xA;surrounded by a crowd eagerly asking:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Where did you leave Rama? How was he&#xA;when you left him?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear people of Ayodhya,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Sumantra, &amp;ldquo;Rama and Lakshmana have&#xA;crossed the Ganga. Ordering me to return&#xA;home, they entered the forest on foot.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A great cry of grief rose from the&#xA;multitude and many cursed themselves&#xA;and attributed the catastrophe to their own&#xA;sins. On both sides of the streets, women&#xA;stood as the chariot passed and cried:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look at the car which departed with the&#xA;princes and Sita and has come back&#xA;empty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sumantra drove forward covering his&#xA;face with the end of his upper garment,&#xA;ashamed of himself. He stopped the&#xA;chariot in front of Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s palace and&#xA;alighted.&#xA;There in front of the palace a great&#xA;crowd had gathered. Women were saying,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How is Sumantra going to meet Kausalya&#xA;and tell her that he left her son in the&#xA;forest? How will she survive the report?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With increasing sorrow and confusion,&#xA;Sumantra entered the Queen&amp;rsquo;s apartment.&#xA;There he saw the King more dead than&#xA;alive. In low tones, he spoke of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;message to the King who heard it in heart-&#xA;broken silence.&#xA;Then Kausalya, unable to control her&#xA;wrath, addressed the King: &amp;ldquo;Here stands&#xA;your minister who has returned from the&#xA;forest after leaving my child to fulfil your&#xA;command. Why are you silent? It was&#xA;easy and pleasant to give boons to&#xA;Kaikeyi. Why are you ashamed of it now?&#xA;Did you not know that this would be the&#xA;result of what you did? You have honored&#xA;your word. You may be happy over that.&#xA;But who can share my sorrow with me? I&#xA;have to bear it all. My grief cannot be&#xA;reduced by your pain. No convention&#xA;binds you to feel or appear to be grieved&#xA;for what you have deliberately done. Why&#xA;are you silent? You need not refrain from&#xA;giving expression to sorrow for fear of&#xA;offending Kaikeyi, for she is not here.&#xA;Surely you should inquire of Sumantra&#xA;about Rama. Have you no humanity? Why&#xA;do you try to suppress even natural&#xA;feelings?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Her grief and love for Rama blinded&#xA;her to the state of her husband&amp;rsquo;s body and&#xA;mind.&#xA;Instead&#xA;of&#xA;lightening,&#xA;she&#xA;aggravated his suffering.&#xA;Dasaratha opened his eyes and&#xA;Sumantra reported duly Rama&amp;rsquo;s message&#xA;in his own words.&#xA;Sumantra tried his best to console&#xA;Kausalya. But she went on repeating:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Take me and leave me where Rama is.&#xA;Young Sita is there with him facing the&#xA;hardships of the forest. I cannot bear this&#xA;agony. Let me go to Dandaka and be with&#xA;Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sumantra answered: &amp;ldquo;Queen, be brave.&#xA;Banish this grief. Rama spends his time&#xA;even more happily in the forest than he&#xA;did in Ayodhya. He feels no sorrow.&#xA;Lakshmana finds joy in the supreme job&#xA;of dutiful service to the brother he loves.&#xA;He is very happy. As for Sita, there in the&#xA;forest, as here in the palace, she lives for&#xA;Rama with every breath and knows&#xA;neither fear nor sorrow. She spends her&#xA;time as though she was a sylvan goddess&#xA;and is as happy there as she was here&#xA;playing in the groves and gardens of&#xA;Ayodhya. The beauty of her face is still&#xA;like the rising moon&amp;rsquo;s. Like a forest fawn&#xA;she lives there with care-free grace,&#xA;spending the, golden hours with Rama by&#xA;her side. Every sight and sound is a new&#xA;source of joy to her and the theme of talk&#xA;with Rama and Lakshmana. Walking&#xA;barefoot, her feet are red like the lotus,&#xA;and need no painting with henna. She&#xA;walks in the forest as if she were dancing.She only lacks the tinkling anklets to&#xA;make it complete. All that I say is true.&#xA;There is no need for you to grieve. The&#xA;three of them are fulfilling their sacred&#xA;duty and offering an object lesson to the&#xA;world. They are making the King&amp;rsquo;s word&#xA;good. Their life will be remembered and&#xA;praised forever. Why, then, should we&#xA;grieve for them?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With such talk, Kausalya would be&#xA;consoled for a while. But soon she would&#xA;break down again and cry: &amp;ldquo;Alas, alas,&#xA;Rama, my child.&amp;rdquo; Her grief seemed&#xA;redoubled when she saw Sumantra come&#xA;back, leaving Rama in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dasaradha had been driven ruthlessly&#xA;by circumstances to an action which not&#xA;only broke his heart but made him hate&#xA;himself and deprived him even of self-&#xA;pity. The only way out of the dilemma of&#xA;either breaking his plighted word or doing&#xA;a great wrong to Rama would have been&#xA;for the latter to disobey him and insist on&#xA;his rights. But Rama placed his duty to his&#xA;father high above all other things. And&#xA;Rama was all the world to Sita and&#xA;Lakshmana. So they had all gone together.&#xA;To Dasaratha, agonising on his bed of&#xA;pain in desolation and remorse, Kausalya&#xA;spoke reproachful words.&#xA;The&#xA;stinging&#xA;words&#xA;in&#xA;which&#xA;Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s sorrow found expression&#xA;caused excruciating pain to Dasaratha, but&#xA;she seemed to find some relief in giving&#xA;vent to her feelings in this way.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Proud of having kept your word and&#xA;happy in young Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s approval and&#xA;gratification, have you any thought for&#xA;others? You have been my world and my&#xA;god, my joy in this world and my hope for&#xA;the next and you have forsaken me. My&#xA;son, the light of my life, has been&#xA;wrenched away from me and banished. I&#xA;live here alone, old, helpless woman,&#xA;without the love of my lord or the sight of&#xA;my only son. Was ever a woman left more&#xA;desolate? But you, are you not delighted&#xA;with what you have done? It is enough for&#xA;you that Kaikeyi and Bharata are happy.&#xA;You need not entertain any fear that Rama&#xA;will mar that happiness, even if he&#xA;returned from the forest after fourteen&#xA;years. He will not touch the kingdom once&#xA;ruled by Bharata. The tiger does not touch&#xA;the leavings of another animal&amp;rsquo;s. Like a&#xA;fish, eating its offspring, you have killed&#xA;your own child.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Touched to the quick, the King even in&#xA;the intensity of his anguish turned to his&#xA;wife with a humble prayer for forgiveness&#xA;with clasped hands.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Have pity on me, Kausalya,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;moaned. &amp;ldquo;You have been kind and&#xA;forgiving even to strangers. Do have some&#xA;compassion on your husband who has&#xA;always loved and honored you and whose&#xA;heart is broken by a sorrow which knows&#xA;no remedy!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These piteous words and the sight of&#xA;her husband in supplication and the&#xA;memory of happier hours pierced the&#xA;noble queen to the heart and she fell at his&#xA;feet&#xA;imploring&#xA;forgiveness&#xA;for&#xA;unbecoming words forced out of her by&#xA;grief.&#xA;As the leaden hours crept slowly on,&#xA;Dasaratha remembered something that&#xA;had happened long ago and it aggravated&#xA;the anguish of his heart.&#xA;The King turned to Kausalya and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Are you still here, my dear? The fruit of&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s action can never be escaped. I now&#xA;endure the result of a great sin that I&#xA;committed in the days that are gone. Men&#xA;in their ignorance sometimes do great&#xA;evils for the sake of some slight&#xA;momentary pleasure. Then when the time&#xA;comes, the price has to be paid. When I&#xA;was young, I had the skill to use my bow&#xA;against unseen targets aiming by soundonly. For the pleasure of exercising this&#xA;skill, I once killed an innocent man and&#xA;committed a great sin. Listen, I shall relate&#xA;to you that sad adventure. It was before&#xA;you came to me. One night I went, out in&#xA;my chariot to hunt on the banks of the&#xA;Sarayu. It had been raining heavily and,&#xA;from the mountainsides, the streams were&#xA;running dyed with the rich colors of&#xA;minerals and fresh soil. The birds were&#xA;silent. The forest seemed asleep. I could&#xA;take the aim by the ear and shoot, without&#xA;seeing, a tiger or bear or other wild beast&#xA;that might come to slake its thirst in the&#xA;stream. I wanted to test this skill of mine.&#xA;It was dense darkness. I waited for some&#xA;wild animal to come. Then I heard a&#xA;gurgling sound as of an elephant drinking.&#xA;At once I aimed an arrow in the direction&#xA;whence the sound came. Like a venomous&#xA;serpent, swish went my dart and hit the&#xA;object. But I was shocked to hear a human&#xA;voice exclaim &amp;lsquo;Alas! I am dead!&amp;rsquo; I heard&#xA;the man cry again piteously, &amp;lsquo;Who can be&#xA;my enemy? Never have I done any harm&#xA;to anyone. Who then could want to kill me&#xA;thus as I was filling my pitcher with&#xA;water? What could he gain by this? Why&#xA;should anyone bear hate against one living&#xA;his innocent hermit life in the forest?&#xA;What is to happen to my old blind parents&#xA;now, with none to look after them? O&#xA;misery!&amp;rsquo; Horror-struck, I stood trembling&#xA;in every limb. My bow and arrow slipped&#xA;from my hands. I approached the place&#xA;from where the voice came and I found a&#xA;young ascetic lying on the ground with&#xA;dishevelled hair, covered all over with&#xA;blood and earth. Beside him lay an&#xA;upturned pitcher. The look of his eyes was&#xA;as fire. When he saw me, he cried, &amp;lsquo;O&#xA;Sinner that has killed me! Why did you&#xA;aim your arrow at me that was taking&#xA;water from the stream? My old blind&#xA;parents are thirsty and are waiting for me&#xA;in the ashrama, thinking that I would&#xA;return with my pitcher filled. Why did you&#xA;kill me? O God, my penances and my&#xA;devotions have all gone to naught. My&#xA;parents do not know that I lie here&#xA;stricken and helpless. They will go on&#xA;waiting for me and even if they knew it,&#xA;what could they do, blind and helpless?&#xA;Who are you? What! Are you not the&#xA;King of Kosala? And so, you, the King,&#xA;who should by right protect me, have slain&#xA;me. Very well, O King, go yourself and&#xA;tell them what you have done. Fall at their&#xA;feet and beg for forgiveness. Else, their&#xA;anger will reduce you to ashes. Go&#xA;straight to the ashrama. Take that path&#xA;there. Go at once and save yourself. But&#xA;this arrow is a torture. Pull it out and&#xA;relieve me of the pain before you go.&amp;rsquo; I&#xA;knew that if I pulled out the arrow from&#xA;his body, his pain would end indeed, but&#xA;so would his life in a gush of blood. My&#xA;hand refused to do the deed. For a while I&#xA;stood, not knowing what to do. Then, the&#xA;young ascetic said: &amp;lsquo;Do not hesitate. Do&#xA;end my pain. My mind is now clear and I&#xA;have calmed myself. Boldly pull out the&#xA;arrow and release my life.&amp;rsquo; Gently I pulled&#xA;the arrow out. The young ascetic turned&#xA;on the ground, heaved a sigh and, with his&#xA;eyes fixed on me, breathed his last. It is&#xA;this crime of mine that is now pursuing&#xA;me. The agony of those blind parents who&#xA;were deprived by me of their son has&#xA;come now for me to endure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dasaratha continued: &amp;ldquo;Listen, I shall&#xA;tell you what followed. Having committed&#xA;a sin and seeing the young ascetic die, I&#xA;stood wondering what-to do next. Finally&#xA;I decided that it was my duty and my&#xA;interest to do what he advised me. I&#xA;cleaned the pitcher, and filling it with&#xA;fresh water, took it and went along the&#xA;footpath he had pointed out. I reached his&#xA;cottage and there I saw the old couple&#xA;waiting for the return of their son. Theysat there like two birds with broken wings&#xA;shrivelled in body and unable to move.&#xA;Both were blind. They were speaking to&#xA;each other about the long delay of their&#xA;son in fetching water from the stream. I&#xA;was filled with terror as I slowly&#xA;approached them. The old man, hearing&#xA;my footsteps, mumbled: &amp;lsquo;Why this long&#xA;delay, my son? Quickly give me some&#xA;water to drink. Your mother too is athirst.&#xA;Were you making your pleasure in the&#xA;stream? Was this the cause of your delay,&#xA;son? Why are you silent? Even if your&#xA;mother or I have offended you in any&#xA;manner, you should not take it to heart.&#xA;You are a perfect son and our only prop.&#xA;We have lost our eyesight and you serve&#xA;as our eyes. Indeed you are more than our&#xA;life to us. Why are you still silent? Are&#xA;you still angry. I trembled in fear when I&#xA;heard the toothless old man talking thus.&#xA;Gathering courage I began: &amp;lsquo;O, holy one, I&#xA;am Dasaratha by name, a Kshatriya,&#xA;bound to obey and serve you, though not&#xA;your son. Driven by my former karma, I&#xA;have committed a terrible sin and stand in&#xA;abject humility before you. I went to the&#xA;riverbank for sport, hoping to shoot wild&#xA;beasts. I thought I heard in the darkness an&#xA;elephant drinking water. I aimed my&#xA;arrow, as I am a marksman that can aim&#xA;by sound as well as by sight. It was my&#xA;misfortune and his fate that my arrow&#xA;struck your son as he was filling his&#xA;pitcher, with the gurgling I had mistaken&#xA;for that of an elephant drinking. Thus,&#xA;without intending it, I fatally wounded&#xA;your beloved son. When I went to the spot&#xA;and saw him rolling in blood with my&#xA;arrow stuck in his breast, I cursed myself.&#xA;I was filled with horror and stood not&#xA;knowing what to do. At his request I&#xA;pulled the arrow out to release him from&#xA;the mortal pain. He is dead. I have told&#xA;you the horrible sin I have committed. I&#xA;throw myself at your mercy. I await your&#xA;judgment.&amp;rsquo; The miserable couples were&#xA;struck dumb by my dreadful tale about&#xA;their son. Tears poured from their&#xA;sightless eyes, and the old man said:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;King, your sin is indeed great. But it was&#xA;done in ignorance. And you have come&#xA;yourself to tell me your crime. So you&#xA;shall live. Now take us both to the spot.&#xA;Let us touch our beloved son with our&#xA;hands and send him into Yama&amp;rsquo;s keeping.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;I carried them to the river bank where&#xA;their son lay dead. They felt his body all&#xA;over, cried and blessed his soul and&#xA;performed the cremation. Then before&#xA;ascending the funeral pyre and giving&#xA;them selves up to the fire, they turned to&#xA;me and said: &amp;lsquo;This great grief you have&#xA;brought about for us, you too, will endure&#xA;in good time. You will die of grief parted&#xA;from your son.&amp;rsquo; Saying this, they burnt&#xA;themselves and their souls joined the&#xA;gods. My sin has pursued me and I am&#xA;now in its grip. My old crime is killing me&#xA;now. As food prohibited by they doctors&#xA;foolishly consumed by a sick man kills&#xA;him, what that old father uttered in&#xA;unbearable grief has now come true. I&#xA;have sent my innocent son to the forest&#xA;and, unable to bear the grief, I now enter&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode. How else could these&#xA;unnatural events occur? How else could I&#xA;be thus deceived and betrayed? Even if I&#xA;ordered Rama to go to forest, why should&#xA;he obey my unjust command? Why&#xA;should he insist on being exiled? It is the&#xA;curse of that old blind couple, nothing&#xA;else. Kausalya, I do not see you. My sight&#xA;is gone. Death is fast approaching. Come&#xA;nearer and let me feel you. All is over.&#xA;The messengers of Yama are calling me.&#xA;Will Rama come? Shall I see him before I&#xA;die? Oh, I am dying. The oil is all&#xA;consumed and my light is going out! Ah&#xA;Kausalya! Oh Sumitra!&amp;ldquo;His life slowly ebbed away and that&#xA;night at some time unobserved by any, the&#xA;King breathed his last.&#xA;As described by Valmiki in the early&#xA;pages of the epic, Dasaratha was one who&#xA;had mastered all the Vedas and Shastras,&#xA;was a farsighted person, the hero of many&#xA;battles, the performer of many sacrifices,&#xA;follower of dharma, a far-famed king with&#xA;many friends and no foes, and one who&#xA;had conquered his senses. His power was&#xA;like Indra&amp;rsquo;s. His wealth was like Kubera&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;In statesmanship, he was like Manu. Fate&#xA;had ordered that such a one should exile&#xA;his beloved son and die of a broken heart,&#xA;with none by him in his last moments but&#xA;two faithful women stricken by himself&#xA;with a common sorrow.&#xA;Since the King had so often fainted and&#xA;recovered, his death was not immediately&#xA;noticed by Kausalya or Sumitra. They&#xA;were weary, too, with grief and watching,&#xA;and fell into a sleep of fatigue in a corner&#xA;of the apartment. At dawn, the musicians&#xA;and singers, whose duty it was to rouse&#xA;the King from slumber, came to his&#xA;bedchamber and played on instruments&#xA;and sang the usual hymns.&#xA;But they saw no sign of the King&#xA;waking. The royal servants who attended&#xA;to the King&amp;rsquo;s morning needs waited long&#xA;and wondered why he slept till so late.&#xA;Then they made bold to enter the&#xA;apartment and saw him lying dead.&#xA;Soon the news spread and filled the&#xA;palace with grief. The widows of the great&#xA;Dasaratha cried like orphaned children,&#xA;embracing one another in unavailing&#xA;lamentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>24 BHARATA ARRIVES</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kausalya clung to the King&amp;rsquo;s body and&#xA;cried: &amp;ldquo;I shall go with the King to Yama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;abode. How can I live without my son and&#xA;without my husband?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The elders and officers of the palace&#xA;managed to separate her from the dead&#xA;King and take her away. Then they&#xA;discussed about the funeral rites. They&#xA;could not be performed immediately, for&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana had gone to the&#xA;forest and Bharata and Satrughna were far&#xA;away in their uncle&amp;rsquo;s place. It was decided&#xA;to send for Bharata and to keep the body&#xA;immersed in oil till his arrival.&#xA;The great monarch&amp;rsquo;s remains were thus&#xA;kept waiting for Bharata&amp;rsquo;s arrival.&#xA;Ayodhya, the city of splendor, was sunk&#xA;in darkness and lamentation. Crowds of&#xA;women met here and there and reviled&#xA;Kaikeyi. There was anxiety in men&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hearts. The crown prince had gone to the&#xA;forest. Bharata too was far away. Anarchy&#xA;was feared, for no one in those days could&#xA;imagine a people going on without a king.&#xA;After the long night had passed, the&#xA;ministers, officers and elders assembled in&#xA;the hall in the morning. Markandeya,&#xA;Vamadeva,&#xA;Kashyapa,&#xA;Katyayana,&#xA;Gautama, Jabali and other learned men,&#xA;with Sumantra and the other ministers,&#xA;bowed to Vasishtha and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sir, the night we have passed was like&#xA;a century. The King is no more. Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana are in the forest. Bharata and&#xA;Satrughna are in far off Kekaya in their&#xA;grandfather&amp;rsquo;s house. Someone must&#xA;forthwith be asked to take up the&#xA;responsibility of rule. A land without a&#xA;king cannot survive. Order will disappear,&#xA;son will not obey father, nor wife her&#xA;husband. The rains will hold back.&#xA;Thieves and robbers will range at will.&#xA;There will be no mutual trust among&#xA;people. Neither agriculture nor trade can&#xA;flourish. Without a king, the land must&#xA;lose its prosperity. The springs of charity&#xA;will dry up. Festivals and services will&#xA;cease to be performed in temples. There&#xA;will be no expounding of Shastras or&#xA;epics, nor any listeners. People will no&#xA;more sleep with doors open. Culture will&#xA;decline and soon disappear. Penances,vows, enjoyments, learning, all depend on&#xA;the king&amp;rsquo;s protection. The beauty of&#xA;women will vanish. The sense of security&#xA;will be lost. Men will eat one another up&#xA;as, fish do. Cruelty and misery will grow&#xA;apace and lay waste the land. For good to&#xA;prosper and evil to be restrained, a king is&#xA;essential.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Valmiki describes at length the&#xA;dangers of anarchy through the mouths of&#xA;leaders in that assembly.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It looks as if a great darkness has&#xA;enveloped the land,&amp;rdquo; they said. &amp;ldquo;Dharma is&#xA;in danger. Let us forthwith secure a king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vasishtha sent for tried messengers and&#xA;said to them: &amp;ldquo;Start at once. Go straight&#xA;and swift to Kekaya. See that you wear no&#xA;sign of sorrow on your face or show it in&#xA;your behavior. Bharata should not know&#xA;that the King is dead. Tell him simply that&#xA;the family preceptor and ministers want&#xA;his presence at once in Ayodhya and bring&#xA;him along with you with all the speed you&#xA;may. Tell him nothing about Rama and&#xA;Sita going to the forest or the King&amp;rsquo;s death&#xA;on account of grief. To avoid all&#xA;suspicion, take with you the usual gifts of&#xA;jewels and precious garments for&#xA;presentation to the King of Kekaya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;From this we can understand the&#xA;meaning of what the Shastras and Kural&#xA;say about Truth. Truthfulness should be&#xA;such that it needlessly hurts no being in&#xA;the world. The test for right conduct&#xA;including truthfulness is harmlessness.&#xA;This does not mean that truth is&#xA;underrated.&#xA;Soon the messengers were provisioned&#xA;and equipped for the long journey and&#xA;furnished with gifts of honor. Mounted on&#xA;swift and sturdy horses, they sped past&#xA;rivers and forests, up hill and down dale,&#xA;and reached Kekaya, which was&#xA;somewhere to the west of the modern&#xA;Punjab, and found themselves in&#xA;Rajagriha, its capital, where the Ikshvaku&#xA;princes were residing in the palace of their&#xA;maternal uncle. They decided to wait on&#xA;the princes the next morning.&#xA;The night the messengers arrived,&#xA;Bharata had evil dreams and woke up in&#xA;the morning filled with anxiety as to what&#xA;they might portend. His face showed the&#xA;state of his mind. His companions tried to&#xA;entertain him with dance and mirth to&#xA;make him forget his cares, but did not&#xA;succeed.&#xA;We still do not know all the secrets of&#xA;nature and the telepathy of affection.&#xA;Maybe, Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s mental anguish and&#xA;death throes reached Bharata across space&#xA;and caused him his bad dreams. He said to&#xA;himself: &amp;ldquo;It seems to me that death is&#xA;approaching my brother Rama or&#xA;Lakshmana or myself. They say that an&#xA;early morning dream does not fail to be&#xA;fulfilled. And mine has been a terrible&#xA;dream. I am full of fear. I know not what&#xA;to do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Just then the messengers were&#xA;announced. The King of Kekaya and his&#xA;son Yudhajit received the envoys with due&#xA;courtesy.&#xA;They paid their respects to the King&#xA;and that princes, then turned to Bharata&#xA;and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The priests and ministers send you&#xA;their blessings and request you to return at&#xA;once to Ayodhya. They want us to convey&#xA;to you that the need for your presence&#xA;there is most urgent. Please touch for&#xA;acceptance these garments and jewels to&#xA;be given to your uncle and to the King as&#xA;gifts from the palace of Ayodhya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata questioned the messengers&#xA;after the welfare of all at home. The&#xA;manner of his inquiry suggests that he had&#xA;an uneasy premonition that his mother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;headstrong and ambitious nature might&#xA;have had something to do with this hasty&#xA;summons home. &amp;ldquo;And is my mother, the&#xA;haughty and irascible Queen Kaikeyi whobelieves herself all-wise and must always&#xA;have her way, is she in good health?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The messengers must have been at&#xA;their wits&amp;rsquo; end for an answer. The best&#xA;they could make was: &amp;ldquo;O tiger among&#xA;men, all are well whose welfare is dear to&#xA;you. Lakshmi, the goddess of sovereignty,&#xA;whose abode is the lotus, woos you. Get&#xA;into your chariot without loss of time.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;There was an enigmatic thought in this&#xA;greeting, for according to them Bharata&#xA;was to be installed on the throne.&#xA;The prince took leave of his uncle and&#xA;grandfather for returning home and&#xA;preparations were made for his departure.&#xA;The old king and Yudhajit collected rare&#xA;and valuable things of their country to be&#xA;sent as gifts to King Dasaratha and Prince&#xA;Rama of Ayodhya. Bharata and Satrughna&#xA;mounted their chariots and started with a&#xA;big retinue towards Ayodhya. They&#xA;travelled fast, unmindful of fatigue, and&#xA;by forced marches reached Ayodhya on&#xA;the morning of the eighth day.&#xA;As he approached the city, Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;mind was filled with misgiving. Nothing&#xA;seemed to be as it was before, and the air&#xA;seemed heavy with disaster. He asked the&#xA;charioteer: &amp;ldquo;Why does the city wear such&#xA;a strange look? I do not see the usual&#xA;crowds of people going in and coming out&#xA;in the gardens outside the city. One used&#xA;to see young men and women with bright,&#xA;cheerful faces. But now they all seem&#xA;sad.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s chariot entered the city&#xA;through the Victory Gate. The streets,&#xA;houses and temples were bare and&#xA;unadorned. The faces of the people looked&#xA;drawn and famished.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why are the musical instruments&#xA;silent?&amp;rdquo; he asked. &amp;ldquo;Why are the citizens&#xA;not decked with flowers and sandal paste?&#xA;These are all bad signs. I cannot repress&#xA;my anxiety.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Inauspicious&#xA;omens&#xA;were&#xA;seen&#xA;everywhere. Bharata concluded that some&#xA;great misfortune had overtaken the city&#xA;and that was the reason why he had been&#xA;so hastily sent for. He entered Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;palace. The King was not to be seen. His&#xA;anxiety increased.&#xA;He then entered Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s palace.&#xA;When she saw her son after a long&#xA;absence, she jumped from her golden&#xA;couch to embrace him. He bent down and&#xA;touched her feet. She kissed his head and&#xA;welcomed him with maternal blessings.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Did you have a good journey?&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;asked. &amp;ldquo;Are your uncle and grandfather&#xA;well? Tell me all about them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He answered: &amp;ldquo;The journey took seven&#xA;days. All our people at Kekaya are happy&#xA;and well. Grandfather and uncle send you&#xA;their love. They have sent rich gifts for&#xA;you, but these will arrive later. I have&#xA;come in advance. The envoys hurried me,&#xA;saying there was urgent work demanding&#xA;my presence here. What is all this about? I&#xA;went to the King&amp;rsquo;s palace to pay him my&#xA;respects. He was not to be found there and&#xA;here too his couch is empty. Perhaps he is&#xA;with one of my senior mothers. I must go&#xA;and see him and tender my respects.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Bharata, innocent of heart and&#xA;unaware of what had happened, said this,&#xA;the foolish queen intoxicated with a new&#xA;sense of power answered: &amp;ldquo;My child, your&#xA;father had his full share of the blessings of&#xA;this life. His fame was great. He&#xA;performed all the sacrifices enjoined by&#xA;tradition. He was a refuge for the good.&#xA;He has now entered the higher world and&#xA;joined the gods.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On hearing this, Bharata fell down&#xA;uttering a cry, his long arms stretched out&#xA;on the ground. Rising, he looked at his&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s empty bed and sobbed like a&#xA;destitute orphan. The mighty hero threw&#xA;his god-like frame on the earth and wept&#xA;like a child in uncontrolled grief.Looking at her son, who lay on the&#xA;ground like a big tree fallen to the axe,&#xA;Kaikeyi said: &amp;ldquo;Arise, O King. Stand up. It&#xA;is not right for a king thus to mourn and&#xA;roll on the ground. Honor and glory are&#xA;waiting for your acceptance. You are to&#xA;uphold the dharma and perform sacrifices&#xA;in the way of your royal fathers. Your&#xA;intelligence shines like the noonday sun.&#xA;No misfortune dare come near you. Son,&#xA;strong of limb and brave-hearted, stand&#xA;up.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;mind&#xA;was&#xA;immaculate,&#xA;spotless. He did not see all that Kaikeyi&#xA;had put in this her appeal!&#xA;After lamenting long, he got up and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;When I went to my uncle&amp;rsquo;s house I&#xA;had hoped that Rama&amp;rsquo;s installation as&#xA;Yuvaraja would come off soon and that on&#xA;my return I would see the great festive&#xA;ceremonies. How differently have things&#xA;turned out! How am I to bear this&#xA;calamity? No more shall I see my father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&amp;lsquo;face. What did he die of? How did he get&#xA;the illness? And I was not by his side&#xA;when he lay sick! It was given to Rama to&#xA;tend him in his last moments. How&#xA;affectionate the King was towards me! If&#xA;some dust settled on my body, he would&#xA;wipe it with his hand. And how soft and&#xA;pleasing was his touch! And it was not&#xA;given me to serve him in his need. But&#xA;mother where is Rama? Hereafter he is&#xA;both father and preceptor to me. I must&#xA;see him at once and kiss his feet. He is&#xA;now my sole refuge. What was my father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;last message to me? I want his very&#xA;words.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s answer had to be consistent&#xA;both with truth and her designs. She was&#xA;pulled in contrary directions by her&#xA;culture and her ambition. She found words&#xA;which conveyed that the King did not&#xA;think of Bharata in his last moments. She&#xA;also wished to prepare him for the rest of&#xA;the news. She said: &amp;ldquo;Your father breathed&#xA;his last crying, &amp;lsquo;Ha, Rama, Ha,&#xA;Lakshmana, Ha, Janaki.&amp;rsquo; These were his&#xA;last words.&amp;rdquo; He died saying: &amp;ldquo;It is not&#xA;given me to live to see Rama, Lakshmana&#xA;and Sita return. Happy they who will see&#xA;their return.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to this, Bharata gathered that&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana too were absent&#xA;from the Kings side. His grief increased&#xA;and he asked Kaikeyi: &amp;ldquo;Where. Were&#xA;they? What business took them away from&#xA;our father&amp;rsquo;s side during his last moments?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hoping to pacify him, Kaikeyi said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My son, Rama put on the garments of an&#xA;ascetic and, taking Lakshmana and Sita&#xA;with him, went to the Dandaka forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s amazement now knew no&#xA;bounds. He asked: &amp;ldquo;I understand nothing&#xA;of what you are saying. What sin did&#xA;Rama commit that he should undertake&#xA;such expiation? Did be rob any Brahmana&#xA;or cause bodily hurt to any innocent&#xA;person or desire somebody else&amp;rsquo;s wife?&#xA;Why did he have to go to the forest? Who&#xA;laid on him this penance?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In those days people went of their own&#xA;will or were sent to the forest as a&#xA;purifying punishment for such and other&#xA;heinous crimes. Now Kaikeyi shaken out&#xA;of silence by this tempest of questions&#xA;came out with the truth foolishly hoping&#xA;for the best.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rama committed no crime. He neither&#xA;robbed nor harmed anyone. And it was&#xA;not in Rama&amp;rsquo;s nature to cast eyes of desire&#xA;at other people&amp;rsquo;s wives. What happened&#xA;was that, seeing that preparations were&#xA;afoot for installing him as crown prince&#xA;and regent, I approached the King for&#xA;your sake and secured the fulfillment of&#xA;two boons he had long ago granted to me.&#xA;I asked that the kingdom should go to you&#xA;and that Rama should be exiled to the&#xA;forest. Bound by his past promise, the&#xA;King agreed. Rama has therefore gone to&#xA;the forest with Sita and Lakshmana.Unable to bear this separation, your father&#xA;expired of grief. Do not waste yourself in&#xA;vain lamentations now. Think now what&#xA;you should do. You know dharma. Your&#xA;duty is to accept the burden of kingship. I&#xA;did all this for your sake and you should&#xA;accept the fruit of my action in the spirit&#xA;in which I acted. The city and kingdom&#xA;have come into your possession without&#xA;your wanting or working for it. Following&#xA;the injunctions of Vasishtha and other&#xA;learned men, perform duly your father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;obsequies and then prepare for the&#xA;coronation. You are a Kshatriya. You&#xA;have inherited your father&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.&#xA;Attend to what has fallen to you as your&#xA;duty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now Bharata understood everything&#xA;and realised the enormity of the harm&#xA;wrought by his mother.&#xA;Overwhelmed by grief and near, he&#xA;could not control himself. At the thought&#xA;of what she had done and the eternal&#xA;infamy she had incurred, his grief grew&#xA;wild and he hurled cruel words at her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What have you done?&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;Did&#xA;you ever hope to make me accept the&#xA;kingdom? Deprived of such a father and&#xA;such a brother, am I likely to care for&#xA;power? After causing the death of the&#xA;King and the banishment of Rama, you&#xA;ask me to take their place and rule the&#xA;land. This is like pouring oil into the fire&#xA;of my grief. How unfortunate was my&#xA;father to have chosen you for a wife!&#xA;Kausalya and Sumitra will also die of&#xA;grief. Oh, how could you bring yourself to&#xA;do this to Rama who was so devoted to&#xA;you? Revered mother Kausalya treated&#xA;you like her own blood-sister. How could&#xA;you think of plotting against her beloved&#xA;son? And did you not know how much I&#xA;loved Rama? Greed destroyed your&#xA;understanding. How else could you so&#xA;foolishly plan for my happiness? Even the&#xA;great King relied on Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana. How could you believe that&#xA;in their absence I could rule the kingdom?&#xA;And, even if I could, would I agree?&#xA;Never will your wish be fulfilled through&#xA;my cooperation. I can no longer regard&#xA;you as my mother. I cut myself off from&#xA;all relation with you and decline to regard&#xA;you as my mother. How could you ever&#xA;think of setting aside rule and custom and&#xA;getting a younger son crowned? Would&#xA;not the world revile us for all time? The&#xA;general law of kings and the tradition of&#xA;our family cannot be violated. I will not&#xA;carry out your wish. I shall go to the forest&#xA;and bring Rama back. I shall set the crown&#xA;on his head and rejoice in being his loyal&#xA;servant.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To understand Bharata&amp;rsquo;s feelings, we&#xA;should keep in mind his innate noble&#xA;nature, his love for Rama, his grief for his&#xA;father and the sense of guilt and shame&#xA;that for his sake his mother had done this&#xA;grievous wrong. We should not weigh his&#xA;words in dry air and a chemical balance.&#xA;In such contexts, poetry flashes fire. One&#xA;sees it both in Valmiki and Kamban.&#xA;Bharata raised his voice and spoke&#xA;again: &amp;ldquo;Banish Rama indeed! It is you that&#xA;ought to be banished, cruel woman, who&#xA;have forsaken the path of dharma. So far&#xA;as you are concerned you may take it that&#xA;I am dead, for I would rather be dead than&#xA;be son to a murderess! Murderess of your&#xA;husband! You are not the daughter of the&#xA;good King Asvapati. You are a Rakshasi.&#xA;To what hell should you go, you, who&#xA;banished the only child of mother&#xA;Kausalya? What punishment would be too&#xA;great for the grief you have caused her?&#xA;Kamadhenu,&#xA;the&#xA;cow-mother,&#xA;had&#xA;hundreds of thousands of children, yet she&#xA;shed tears at the sight of the suffering of&#xA;two bulls yoked to a plough and her tears&#xA;scalded Indra on his throne in high&#xA;Heaven. And Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s only child yousent to the forest, hoping thus that you and&#xA;I could be made happy! I shall do the&#xA;obsequies and go to the forest and fall at&#xA;the feet of Rama and bring him to his&#xA;kingdom. And then, to cleanse&#xA;myself of the sin and the shame you&#xA;have brought on me, I shall lead the life of&#xA;an ascetic in the Dandaka forest. What a&#xA;flood of sorrow have you let loose on the&#xA;earth? By what penitence, by what self-&#xA;mortification, can you redeem yourself? I&#xA;shall go myself at once to Rama and get&#xA;rid of my guilt by restoring the kingdom&#xA;to him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Finding no relief for his anguish by&#xA;angry words, sighing like a young&#xA;elephant newly captured, hot tears-falling&#xA;from his eyes, he felt he could bear no&#xA;longer the sight of his mother and rushed&#xA;to Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s apartment, there to find a&#xA;better place to give vent to his sorrow.&#xA;Thus did Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s castle in the air go&#xA;up in smoke. She lay down on the floor&#xA;and wept. The most painful of all&#xA;reflexions is that of a crime perpetrated in&#xA;vain.&#xA;Among&#xA;the&#xA;characters&#xA;in&#xA;the&#xA;Ramayana, Bharata is the perfect&#xA;embodiment of virtue. In the villages of&#xA;the North, the people celebrate an annual&#xA;festival for the episode of the meeting of&#xA;Rama and Bharata at Chitrakuta, which&#xA;they consider the most sanctifying part of&#xA;the Ramayana epic. There have been&#xA;through the ages great and noble souls&#xA;whose virtue shines eternally in the midst&#xA;of the sordid self-seeking of a sinful&#xA;world, as a beacon light to seekers of the&#xA;right path, and as a token of the god in&#xA;man.&#xA;Soon the news of Bharata&amp;rsquo;s arrival&#xA;spread throughout the palace. Kausalya,&#xA;still laboring under her grief, heard this,&#xA;and was glad and told Sumitra, &amp;ldquo;Come, let&#xA;us go and meet Bharata.&amp;rdquo; Hardly had they&#xA;taken a couple of steps when they saw&#xA;Bharata himself rushing wildly towards&#xA;them to plead for mercy.&#xA;Kausalya&amp;rsquo;s first thought when she&#xA;heard of Bharata&amp;rsquo;s arrival was that he had&#xA;hastened back to assume the fortune&#xA;which had come to him. Had not the&#xA;elders and ministers, led by Vasishtha,&#xA;decided to send for Bharata so that he&#xA;might perform his father&amp;rsquo;s obsequies and&#xA;be crowned king? Hence, seeing Bharata,&#xA;Kausalya, her heart desolate with her loss&#xA;of husband and son, said in a low voice:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bharata, the kingship is waiting secured&#xA;for your sake by Kaikeyi. You need not&#xA;fear any let or hindrance from us. Take it,&#xA;and may all happiness be yours. Only one&#xA;boon I crave of you to let me join your&#xA;father on the funeral pyre.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These words were like stinging poison&#xA;in Bharata&amp;rsquo;s ears. He fell at her feet and&#xA;clung to them, unable to speak.&#xA;Kausalya said again: &amp;ldquo;Oh Bharata, at&#xA;least take me where Rama is in the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unable to bear all these piteous words&#xA;of Kausalya and unable to speak, Bharata&#xA;fell into a swoon. After a while he sat up&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;Mother, why do you thus&#xA;torture me who am innocent? You know I&#xA;was far away and knew nothing of the&#xA;wicked things going on here. Do you not&#xA;know the love I bear for Rama? Would I&#xA;ever do such a thing to him? May all the&#xA;sins of the world descend on me if I had&#xA;the least notion of the evil brewing here! I&#xA;had nothing to do with it. I have no desire&#xA;to reap its fruit.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He raised his hands and recited all the&#xA;horrible sins that one could commit and&#xA;invoked on himself the punishments due&#xA;to them if he had any part in the plot.&#xA;In those days as now it was hard for a&#xA;son to prove that he knew nothing of a&#xA;scheme carried out by his mother for his&#xA;benefit. Bharata could only swear his&#xA;innocence again and again. He cared&#xA;nothing for kingdom or wealth or powerand it was a terrible torment to him that&#xA;Kausalya should think him capable of&#xA;greed for them at the expense of his&#xA;brother. Indeed such a thought was hardly&#xA;less cruel and unjust than Rama&amp;rsquo;s exile!&#xA;He could never accept the crown which&#xA;was his beloved brother&amp;rsquo;s birthright.&#xA;His passionate sincerity convinced&#xA;Kausalya of the injustice of her&#xA;suspicions, and her heart went out to him.&#xA;Tenderly she raised him from the ground&#xA;and took his head on her lap and caressed&#xA;him as though he were Rama himself.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My dear son, my grief is doubled by&#xA;seeing the pain raging in your innocent&#xA;heart. What shall we do child? We are the&#xA;playthings of fate. May the reward of&#xA;goodness come to you in this world and&#xA;the next!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kausalya had not believed Bharata&#xA;privy to the plot, but she feared that he&#xA;would condone it and yield to the&#xA;temptation of its results. Now she was&#xA;convinced that Bharata&amp;rsquo;s heart was&#xA;completely free from stain. Though her&#xA;own son had gone to the forest, she was&#xA;pleased that such another son had come to&#xA;her in his place.&#xA;Here, Kamban beautifully sings how&#xA;Kausalya shed tears of joy over Bharata&#xA;and embraced him imagining that Rama&#xA;himself had returned from the forest.&#xA;Kausalya said amidst her sobs: &amp;ldquo;Many&#xA;were your ancestors who attained fame.&#xA;You have surpassed them all in glory by&#xA;renouncing the kingship that has come to&#xA;you. You are indeed king among kings.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Kausalya and Bharata portrayed&#xA;by Kamban embody a culture. May these&#xA;heroic figures and that culture live forever&#xA;in the land of Bharata!&#xA;The obsequies of the dead King were&#xA;duly performed. Vasishtha and other&#xA;learned men and elders offered grave&#xA;shastric consolation to Bharata and&#xA;Satrughna. Fourteen days after the King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;demise, the ministers called the Assembly&#xA;and addressed Bharata thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The King has gone to the world&#xA;above. Rama and Lakshmana are in the&#xA;forest. The land is now without a king. It&#xA;is right that you should assume the rule at&#xA;our request. The preparations for the&#xA;coronation are all complete. The citizens&#xA;and&#xA;ministers&#xA;are&#xA;awaiting&#xA;your&#xA;acceptance. This is your kingdom lawfully&#xA;descended from your ancestors, It is for&#xA;you to be anointed and rule righteously&#xA;over us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata went with folded hands round&#xA;the materials gathered for the coronation&#xA;and said in grave tones to the assembled&#xA;elders:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I do not consider it proper that you&#xA;should ask me thus to accept the kingdom.&#xA;According to the custom of our house, the&#xA;throne belongs to the eldest son. With all&#xA;respect to you, I have decided to go to the&#xA;forest and bring Rama back to Ayodhya&#xA;with Lakshmana and see that Rama is&#xA;crowned. Please get ready the men and&#xA;materials for this purpose. Prepare the&#xA;road for the journey. Let laborers be&#xA;mobilised for it. It is my final and&#xA;irrevocable decision not to accept the&#xA;crown.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to the prince&amp;rsquo;s words, the&#xA;whole assembly was beside itself with joy.&#xA;They applauded Bharata&amp;rsquo;s suggestion. The&#xA;army and a big retinue were got ready to&#xA;accompany the prince to the forest.&#xA;Quickly an army of workers with their&#xA;tools went forward to prepare the road.&#xA;Men who knew the forest, pioneers&#xA;who could dig wells and canals, builders&#xA;of rafts and boats, carpenters and&#xA;engineers,&#xA;worked&#xA;enthusiastically,&#xA;because they were engaged in getting&#xA;beloved Rama back. Culverts were built,&#xA;trees felled, a broad road for the prince&#xA;and his retinue was soon laid. Ups and&#xA;downs were levelled, marshes drained,resting-places for the army and facilities&#xA;for drinking water and all other&#xA;conveniences were soon made ready.&#xA;Though thus preparations were made&#xA;for Bharata&amp;rsquo;s journey to the forest,&#xA;Vasishtha and the other ministers formally&#xA;summoned the Assembly again. They did&#xA;not give up their desire to get Bharata to&#xA;agree to be crowned. They sent&#xA;messengers to Bharata palace and invited&#xA;him to the Hall. They approached him&#xA;with music playing on many instruments.&#xA;All this pained him.&#xA;He stopped the musicians and sent the&#xA;messengers back and told Satrughna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why should they still persist in&#xA;tormenting me when I have refused the&#xA;kingdom? This is the result of our&#xA;mother&amp;rsquo;s intrigue. My father has gone to&#xA;Heaven leaving me to bear all this alone.&#xA;The land needs a king; without one it&#xA;drifts like a rudderless and derelict ship.&#xA;We must soon get Rama back.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Assembly sat eagerly looking for&#xA;the entrance of the blameless prince. He&#xA;entered the Hall as the full moon rises in&#xA;the sky He bowed to the elders and sat&#xA;down.&#xA;Vasishtha said: &amp;ldquo;This kingdom has&#xA;been given to you by your father and your&#xA;brother Rama. Accept it and protect us&#xA;according to ancient custom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s heart was far away with&#xA;Rama. Tears fell from his yes. The young&#xA;prince wept aloud in the midst of the royal&#xA;Assembly and in a voice struggling with&#xA;tears, he addressed words of respectful&#xA;reproach to the preceptors:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How can you ask one of my race and&#xA;upbringing to usurp what belongs to&#xA;another far nobler and more worthy than&#xA;I? Can any son of Dasaratha possibly&#xA;dream of such iniquity? This kingdom and&#xA;I, and all else in it belong to Rama. He is&#xA;the eldest son, the noblest among us, a&#xA;lover of dharma, an equal to Dilipa and&#xA;Nahusha of old. He is the rightful king.&#xA;He is fit to be sovereign in the three&#xA;worlds. Standing here I pay my homage to&#xA;Rama there in the forest. He is the King,&#xA;not I.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Assembly burst into tears of joy&#xA;when they heard Bharata speak thus.&#xA;And Bharata continued: &amp;ldquo;If I am unable&#xA;to persuade King Rama to agree, I shall&#xA;stay there performing penance. It is your&#xA;duty, O Elders, to use every means to&#xA;bring Rama back. I shall do all I can to&#xA;make Rama come back to Ayodhya and&#xA;make him King.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He then ordered Sumantra who was&#xA;standing near him to hasten the&#xA;preparations for going to the forest. The&#xA;city rejoiced in anticipation of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;return, for all felt sure that nothing could&#xA;resist the force of Bharata&amp;rsquo;s dutiful love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GAZING across the river Ganga,&#xA;Guha, the hunter-king, noticed unusual&#xA;commotion on the bank opposite. A great&#xA;army had encamped there. He pointed it to&#xA;his kinsmen standing by his side and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who is this and why has he come here&#xA;with a large army, apparently to cross the&#xA;river? The flag suggests that it is Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son Bharata and his army. Yes, I see the&#xA;flag flying on the top of the chariot and I&#xA;can recognise the tree painted on it. That&#xA;is the flag of the King of Ayodhya. Is not&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s enemy, Bharata, the King of&#xA;Ayodhya too? Having secured the&#xA;kingdom unjustly through his mother&#xA;Kaikeyi, it looks as though he has pursued&#xA;Rama here to slay him. Get together our&#xA;warriors and kinsmen and friends. Let&#xA;them stand ready on this bank. Gather all&#xA;the boats and fill them with armed men&#xA;ready for battle. Let us wait and see. If the&#xA;newcomers are well disposed towards&#xA;Rama, we shall help them to cross the&#xA;river and come over to this side. But, iftheir intention is hostile, we shall prevent&#xA;them from crossing the Ganga.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so having made all preparations,&#xA;Guha, in accordance with rules of&#xA;courtesy, took some presents, got into a&#xA;boat and went to meet Bharata.&#xA;On the other bank at the same time&#xA;Sumantra, was telling Bharata:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look! Guha, the hunter-king, devoted&#xA;friend of Rama, has come with his people&#xA;to welcome us. He is the ruler of this&#xA;region. He and his kinsmen are well&#xA;acquainted with every nook and corner of&#xA;this forest. They could tell us where Rama&#xA;is to found and lead us safely and swiftly&#xA;to the place.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Meanwhile Guha crossed the stream&#xA;and, approaching Bharata, bowed and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Though we have been taken by&#xA;surprise by your unexpected visit, still all&#xA;that is mine here you may consider as&#xA;your own and command me. I consider it&#xA;an honor to be able to welcome and&#xA;entertain you and your army.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata answered: &amp;ldquo;It is very kind of&#xA;you, O friend of my brother, to offer&#xA;hospitality to such a large army. I wish to&#xA;proceed to the hermitage of Bharadwaja.&#xA;We do not know the way, and, we also&#xA;need to cross this great river.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Guha bowed before him with clasped&#xA;hands and said politely: &amp;ldquo;My lord, my&#xA;servants and myself are ready to go with&#xA;you and act as guides. But you must&#xA;excuse me for expressing a doubt which&#xA;occurs to me on seeing this large army&#xA;you have brought. Surely you have no&#xA;intentions hostile to Rama?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Pained by these words and from a heart&#xA;clear and pure as the summer sky, Bharata&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Alas, what greater shame can come&#xA;to me than this, that men who love Rama&#xA;should fear and suspect me? Have no&#xA;misgivings, Guha. Rama is my father&#xA;now, for he has taken the place of my lost&#xA;father. I have come here to beg of him to&#xA;return to Ayodhya. I swear, I have no&#xA;other purpose in my mind.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Guha rejoiced to see in Bharata&amp;rsquo;s face&#xA;his intense love for Rama and his grief at&#xA;what had happened. He said: &amp;ldquo;My Lord,&#xA;who in the world can equal you in&#xA;sacrifice? Who but you would renounce&#xA;such wealth and power coming to him&#xA;unsought? Your glory will shine forever.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The hunter-king supplied Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;army with all it needed. The hosts and the&#xA;guests retired for the night.&#xA;The meeting with Guha only increased&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s sorrow. Bharata was endowed&#xA;with a heart of utter innocence. He sighed&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;AIas, that it should come to&#xA;this,&amp;rdquo; and rolled sleepless on the ground.&#xA;His whole body burned with thoughts of&#xA;the infamy that had come as a cloud over&#xA;him, his father&amp;rsquo;s death and the parting&#xA;from Rama. Guha spoke words of comfort&#xA;and tried to console him. This meeting of&#xA;Bharata and Guha and the way they&#xA;shared their sorrow is an episode dear to&#xA;the Vaishnava Alvars and other true&#xA;Bhaktas.&#xA;Bharat questioned: &amp;ldquo;What food did&#xA;Rama take when he was here? Where did&#xA;he sit? Where did he sleep? What did he&#xA;say? And what did he do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Guha answered every question lovingly&#xA;and pointed the spot where Rama had&#xA;slept. And when he was asked, &amp;ldquo;Where&#xA;did Lakshmana sleep?&amp;rdquo; He replied:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana said, &amp;lsquo;When Rama and Sita&#xA;lie stretched on the bare earth, how can I&#xA;sleep?&amp;rsquo; and he shed tears and, like me,&#xA;stood on guard the whole night, bow in&#xA;hand.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Bharata pictured this scene, his&#xA;grief became unendurable. He saw the&#xA;spot where Rama and Sita had slept that&#xA;night and showed it to the weeping&#xA;queens.&#xA;Asked what Rama ate, Guha answered:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My Lord, they fasted that night.Lakshmana brought some water and Rama&#xA;drank of it and handed it back to&#xA;Lakshmana to drink. The food brought&#xA;was returned untasted. The following&#xA;morning, they matted their locks and&#xA;walked into the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata had found some relief from&#xA;sorrow in his resolve to seek out Rama&#xA;and persuade him to return, but his talk&#xA;with Guha and the sights he saw brought&#xA;it back in full flood.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;For my sake, Rama, you slept on the&#xA;grass. I have seen the spot and still live.&#xA;And they want me to wear a crown, on top&#xA;of all this!&amp;rdquo; Thus he lamented&#xA;inconsolably.&#xA;Then he told himself: &amp;ldquo;I shall somehow&#xA;take Rama back and seat him on the&#xA;throne. If he wants his vow fulfilled, I&#xA;shall replace him in the forest for fourteen&#xA;years. He will agree to this arrangement as&#xA;it is only right and proper.&amp;rdquo; Thus he&#xA;calmed himself.&#xA;Early next morning, Bharata woke up&#xA;Satrughna: &amp;ldquo;What are you still sleeping?&#xA;The day has already dawned. The army&#xA;has to cross the river. We should send&#xA;quickly for Guha and arrange for the&#xA;journey.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Satrughna answered: &amp;ldquo;I am not asleep,&#xA;brother. Like you I spent the whole night&#xA;thinking of Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While they were speaking, Guha&#xA;arrived and after courteous greetings&#xA;announced that he had a fleet of many&#xA;boats ready. All the baggage and the&#xA;whole army were put on boats. The loaded&#xA;vessels crossed the great river. The&#xA;transport across raised a joyous clamor&#xA;like some great festival.&#xA;The people did not see the sorrow in&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s heart for they had concluded,&#xA;even when Bharata set out, that Rama&#xA;would surely return. They went forward&#xA;rejoicing that soon Rama would be in their&#xA;midst as crowned king and all their recent&#xA;sorrows would pass like a bad dream.&#xA;Valmiki describes the scene on the&#xA;bank of the Ganga in a way that recalls to&#xA;one a crowded railway station during a&#xA;popular festival. When the whole army&#xA;had crossed the river, Bharata followed it&#xA;in a boat specially fitted up for him.&#xA;They&#xA;reached&#xA;the ashrama of&#xA;Bharadwaja.&#xA;The story of Bharata in the Ramayana&#xA;portraying a character of unrivalled purity&#xA;and sublime selflessness is something,&#xA;more than an episode, and stands out by&#xA;itself even in that noble epic, as holy&#xA;shrines do on the banks of the Ganga.&#xA;It uplifts the heart, and gives one a&#xA;glimpse of the heights to which human&#xA;nature can rise when cleansed by love and&#xA;devotion. Whether Rama and Bharata&#xA;were incarnations of the Deity or merely&#xA;supreme&#xA;creations&#xA;of&#xA;a&#xA;nation&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;imagination this episode is among the&#xA;masterpieces of the world&amp;rsquo;s literature.&#xA;Jnana and bhakti will automatically&#xA;grow by a contemplation of the&#xA;personality of Bharata. In order to recreate&#xA;the scene and the person in his own mind&#xA;the reader must bring into play his&#xA;reverent imagination. We bring with us&#xA;into this world as our inborn gift some&#xA;wisdom and reverence. This gift is always&#xA;in us and though sometimes obscured by&#xA;prejudice or passion it keeps alive the&#xA;divine in man which prevents him from&#xA;reeling back into the beast.&#xA;Bharata and his retinue went on&#xA;towards Bharadawaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama. When&#xA;they reached the Prayaga wood, they saw&#xA;at a distance a beautiful grove with a&#xA;cottage in its midst. Learning that this was&#xA;Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama, Bharata left his&#xA;retinue behind and, accompanied only by&#xA;Vasishtha and a few other elders, walked&#xA;towards it with due humility.Divesting himself of his silk garments&#xA;and his weapons and accompanied only&#xA;by the ministers he went on foot behind&#xA;Vasishtha. A little further on, he left&#xA;behind even the ministers, and he and&#xA;Vasishtha alone went forward.&#xA;When Bharadwaja saw Vasishtha, he&#xA;rose from his seat and went to meet the&#xA;illustrious visitor and bade his disciples to&#xA;bring the customary water for the feet of&#xA;the guests.&#xA;Bharata offered humble salutations to&#xA;Bharadwaja. Learning who he was, the&#xA;rishi received him with the respect due to&#xA;a king and made inquiries concerning his&#xA;welfare. He thoughtfully refrained from&#xA;making any mention of the sad fate of&#xA;Dasaratha.&#xA;The narration that follows is as told in&#xA;Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s epic. A few words by way of&#xA;explanation may be useful. Bharadwaja&#xA;suspected and questioned Bharata, just as&#xA;Guha had done earlier. This is, however,&#xA;not so put in the Tulasidas Ramayana&#xA;which is a poem of pure bhakti. There is&#xA;nothing that was not within the knowledge&#xA;of rishis. How then could Bharadwaja (in&#xA;the Tulasidas Ramayana) entertain any&#xA;doubt about Bharata?&#xA;Kamban, the Tamil poet of the&#xA;Ramayana, follows Valmiki closely not&#xA;only here but in many other places where&#xA;Tulasidas differs. Although Kamban&#xA;carefully follows Valmiki, he adds many&#xA;beautiful passages out of his own&#xA;imagination. With a touch here and a&#xA;touch there, Kamban manages skilfully to&#xA;disentangle many knots. The changes he&#xA;makes are very few, while Tulasidas deals&#xA;freely with the story, taking such liberties&#xA;as he likes with the story as a great bhakta&#xA;may who has made his god his own by&#xA;self-forgetting surrender.&#xA;Following Valmiki, Kamban reports&#xA;the conversation between Bharadwaja and&#xA;Bharata and very beautifully expresses&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s indignation.&#xA;We may not, reading it all today,&#xA;appreciate Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s doubts about&#xA;innocent Bharata. Such suspicion was&#xA;perfectly natural to Guha, but not so in a&#xA;wise rishi. Valmiki makes the rishi justify&#xA;himself saying: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t I know you, young&#xA;prince? I put you these questions only the&#xA;more clearly to reveal your innocence.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Valmiki&#xA;pictures&#xA;rishis&#xA;not&#xA;as&#xA;omniscient sages, but as very human wise&#xA;men and seekers after truth, liable to love&#xA;and fear somewhat like the rest of us. Just&#xA;as Valmiki delineates Rama as a hero&#xA;rather than as an avatar, so he makes&#xA;Bharadwaja doubt Bharata because of his&#xA;tender affection for Rama. Bound by his&#xA;attachment to Rama, he hurts Bharata.&#xA;Seeing the latter suffer, he at once&#xA;consoles him with an explanation.&#xA;All Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s characters are human&#xA;beings with heightened human qualities. It&#xA;is only under great stress or in exceptional&#xA;circumstances that divinity shines faintly&#xA;through the human nature. In the time of&#xA;Tulasidas, bhakti had reached its noonday&#xA;height. It shone dispelling every shade.&#xA;Though bhakti predominates in Kamban&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;picture also, he contrives to retain the&#xA;humanity of Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s characters and in&#xA;places makes them even more beautiful.&#xA;Bharadwaja, after making the usual&#xA;personal inquiries, asked Bharata: &amp;ldquo;Why&#xA;did you leave your kingly duties and go&#xA;over here? Should you not stay in&#xA;Ayodhya? Listening to his young wife,&#xA;Dasaratha ordered Rama to live for&#xA;fourteen years in the forest and the prince&#xA;accordingly left the city with his brother&#xA;and Sita. Do you feel that even now the&#xA;way is not clear for your rule and have&#xA;you come to complete what Dasaratha&#xA;began and make assurance doubly sure?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these words, Bharata wept.&#xA;The tears gushed and he could hardlyspeak. &amp;ldquo;Death,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;would be better&#xA;than such a life as this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do you doubt me, master?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not blame me for what was done by&#xA;my mother in my absence without my&#xA;knowledge or consent. I have come now&#xA;to do my utmost and persuade Rama to go&#xA;back with me to Ayodhya, and there to be&#xA;crowned King. And it is my purpose to be&#xA;his humble slave all my life. I have come&#xA;here to ask you where Rama dwells, to go&#xA;and beg of him to return home. And me,&#xA;you suspect!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharadwaja said: &amp;ldquo;Bharata, I know&#xA;your real nature. You are a scion of the&#xA;race of Raghu. I questioned you because I&#xA;wished to draw out a revelation of your&#xA;affection and loyalty and thereby establish&#xA;and spread your glory. Do not grieve. The&#xA;Prince is dwelling on Chitrakuta hill. Stay&#xA;here today. Tomorrow, you and your&#xA;ministers shall go there. You will please&#xA;me by accepting hospitality for a day in&#xA;the ashrama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata said: &amp;ldquo;My Lord, your wishes&#xA;and words of affection are a feast. What&#xA;more is required?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharadwaja smilled because he could&#xA;see that Bharata was unwilling to cast the&#xA;burden of feeding an army on a poor&#xA;ascetic. He said: &amp;ldquo;I am bound to entertain&#xA;you in a manner worthy of your status and&#xA;goodness. Why have you left behind your&#xA;army and retinue?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata answered: &amp;ldquo;I followed the rule&#xA;that one should not approach a rishi&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;dwelling with a retinue. There is a big&#xA;crowd following me. It would be a great&#xA;disturbance to you if they all come here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The rishi said: &amp;ldquo;Nothing of the sort.&#xA;Order them all to come up.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so Bharata ordered.&#xA;Bharadwaja went to the sacrificial fire&#xA;and, uttering mantras, sipped water thrice&#xA;and called on Viswakarma, Maya, Yama,&#xA;Varuna, Kubera, Agni and other celestial&#xA;beings and ordered them to produce a&#xA;great feast for Bharata and his followers.&#xA;Then a miracle happened. The feast&#xA;that was ready in Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama&#xA;was like that which Vasishtha gave of old&#xA;to Viswamitra. The only difference was&#xA;that here, there was no quarrel or&#xA;commotion.&#xA;Everyone&#xA;had&#xA;ample&#xA;accommodation. Sandal paste, flowers,&#xA;food and drink, music and dance by divine&#xA;performers were all provided.&#xA;Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;feast&#xA;was&#xA;more&#xA;sumptuous than that given by emulous&#xA;kings to one another. Dwellings, vehicles,&#xA;servants rose suddenly into being. The&#xA;guests forgot themselves in the feast. The&#xA;soldiers in Bharata&amp;rsquo;s army in the ecstasy of&#xA;present enjoyment exclaimed to one&#xA;another: &amp;ldquo;We shall not go to the Dandaka&#xA;forest. We shall not return to Ayodhya.&#xA;We shall stay here forever.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;How were they to know that the good&#xA;things they enjoyed were for a day, and&#xA;would disappear at dawn, like the stage&#xA;and the crowd after a village play is over?&#xA;The guests ate fully and soon fell fast&#xA;asleep.&#xA;The following morning Bharadwaja&#xA;said to Bharata: &amp;ldquo;At a distance of two-and-&#xA;a-half yojanas from here runs the river&#xA;Mandakini. On its banks is an unpeopled&#xA;forest with Chitrakuta hill to its south. On&#xA;the slope of the hill, in a hut your brothers&#xA;and Sita are dwelling.&amp;rdquo; And he explained&#xA;in detail the way they should follow.&#xA;The three queens were presented to&#xA;receive the sage&amp;rsquo;s blessings. &amp;ldquo;This is&#xA;Queen Kausalya,&amp;rdquo; said Bharata, &amp;ldquo;the&#xA;mother of Rama and here, to her right and&#xA;supporting her, stands the mother of&#xA;Lakshmana and Satrughna, sorrow-&#xA;stricken and limp like a creeper stricken&#xA;by summer winds.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;And here is my&#xA;mother, the cause of all our sorrow,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Bharata, pointing to Kaikeyi who alongwith the other Queens prostrated before&#xA;the sage.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not judge your mother harshly,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Bharadwaja casting his gentle eyes&#xA;on the sorrowing lady. &amp;ldquo;All that has&#xA;happened has happened for the good of&#xA;the world.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This episode of introducing the&#xA;mothers is placed by Kamban in the&#xA;earlier scene with Guha. Guha reverently&#xA;inquires about the queens and Bharata&#xA;explains. What Valmiki describes as&#xA;having taken place in Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;ashrama is, with more poetical effect,&#xA;transferred by Kamban to its proper place.&#xA;Introducing Kausalya to Guha, Bharata&#xA;says, in the Ramayana of Kamban: &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;is the mother of Rama. Her treasure was&#xA;Rama and she lost it because of me.&amp;rdquo; Of&#xA;Sumitra he said: &amp;ldquo;This is the mother of&#xA;Lakshmana, truer brother to Rama, who&#xA;has a happiness beyond the reach of poor&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo; Kaikeyi in Kamban, as in Valmiki, is&#xA;introduced by Bharata in harsh terms.&#xA;Bharata and his great retinue took the&#xA;forest path as directed by Bharadwaja.&#xA;They saw from afar the Chitrakuta hill and&#xA;as they proceeded eagerly a column of&#xA;smoke indicated the spot where the&#xA;prince&amp;rsquo;s dwelling was and shouts of joy&#xA;arose from the crowd. Leaving his&#xA;following behind, Bharata went forward&#xA;accompanied only by Sumantra and&#xA;Vasishtha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHILE Bharata was thus engaged in&#xA;trying to undo the mischief wrought by&#xA;others, in the forest hut at Chitrakuta, life&#xA;went&#xA;on&#xA;fairly&#xA;cheerfully.&#xA;With&#xA;Lakshmana and Sita by his side, Rama&#xA;lacked nothing. The grandeur of the&#xA;mountain scenery and the forest and the&#xA;sweet songs and play of the birds pleased&#xA;his heart. He forgot the sorrow of his exile&#xA;from kinsfolk and city.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look, Sita, at those birds playing,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;would say. &amp;ldquo;Look at that rock on the hill&#xA;with the blue, yellow and red veins&#xA;shining on it. Look at these plants and&#xA;creepers with their flowers. We feared life&#xA;in the forest, not knowing how pleasant it&#xA;would be. I am so happy here. And I have&#xA;in addition to this pleasure the feeling that&#xA;I carry out my father&amp;rsquo;s promise. We have&#xA;the joy of duty done besides leading a&#xA;happy life here. Over and above all this, I&#xA;am happy that my brother Bharata is&#xA;ruling the kingdom.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Rama, free from sorrow himself,&#xA;made Sita happy. Descending from the&#xA;hill they would sometimes go to the river&#xA;Mandakini and spend time there.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look at those sand hillocks,&amp;rdquo; Rama&#xA;would say. &amp;ldquo;Look at the swans playing&#xA;among the lotuses. The stream is as lovely&#xA;as yourself, beloved. The fords where&#xA;animals come to drink are beautifully red&#xA;with new earth. Even the river in Kubera&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;kingdom cannot be as beautiful as this.&#xA;Sea the rishis bathing there and standing&#xA;in supplication and offering hymns to the&#xA;sun. Look at the flowers falling from the&#xA;boughs on the water. Look at that pearl-&#xA;scattering cascade. We are indeed lucky to&#xA;be far away from the crowded city here in&#xA;the forest. There, we cannot see rishis and&#xA;pure souls such as we see here bathing&#xA;everyday. This hill is our Ayodhya. The&#xA;birds and beasts are our subjects. The&#xA;Mandakini is our Sarayu. With you and&#xA;Lakshmana by me, I am so happy and&#xA;content. How pleasant it is to see the&#xA;animals drinking water in the stream&#xA;without any fear! Plunging in the water&#xA;here, eating fruits and roots, walking&#xA;about in the forest and climbing the hills,&#xA;why should I think of kingdom or&#xA;power?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus, in the company of Sita and&#xA;Lakshmana, Rama was spending happy&#xA;days.One day as they were sitting as usual&#xA;on the slope of the hill in utter peace,&#xA;suddenly at a distance, they saw a cloud of&#xA;dust rise in the sky which seemed moving&#xA;towards them. And soon they heard a&#xA;great noise as of a big crowd. Rama saw&#xA;the forest animals stampeding hither and&#xA;thither in fear. It looked as if an army&#xA;entered the forest.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do you hear that noise?&amp;rdquo; Rama said to&#xA;Lakshmana, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The elephants, bisons and&#xA;deer are running helter skelter. What&#xA;could it be? Could it be some king come&#xA;here hunting? Or is it that some tiger or&#xA;other fierce wild beast has come&#xA;rummaging? Just see and tell me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana climbed up a tall tree and&#xA;looked all around. He saw a large army&#xA;approaching from the north, a complete&#xA;force of all limbs, chariots, elephants,&#xA;horses and foot soldiers.&#xA;He shouted to Rama in warning:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Listen, brother. A great army is&#xA;approaching with flags flying and in&#xA;complete formation. Let us be careful. Put&#xA;out the fire. Take Sita into the cave for&#xA;safety. Let us don our armor and get ready&#xA;for battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama said: &amp;ldquo;Do not be in such hurry.&#xA;Look again at the flag on the chariot and&#xA;tell me which king is leading his army&#xA;here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana looked and was filled with&#xA;anger. &amp;ldquo;O my brother, it is Bharata. Not&#xA;satisfied with getting the kingdom, he is&#xA;pursuing us here. I can see the tree on our&#xA;flag flying in the breeze. He has come to&#xA;slay us. But the son of Kaikeyi shall not&#xA;escape with life from me today. What sin&#xA;is there in killing this destroyer of&#xA;dharma? The only question now is, shall&#xA;we wait for them here, or shall we give&#xA;them battle on the top of the hill? We will&#xA;make him pay for all the harm be has done&#xA;us. It is surely no sin to kill one who&#xA;comes to slay us. With him will be&#xA;destroyed the greed of his mother. You&#xA;will soon see the forest paths running with&#xA;blood. Like a tree uprooted by an&#xA;elephant, Bharata will be felled to the&#xA;ground by me. We shall destroy this army.&#xA;We shall feed fat the beasts of prey in the&#xA;forest. &amp;quot; Lakshmana spoke thus, beside&#xA;himself with rage.&#xA;Rama proceeded to calm him. &amp;ldquo;I know&#xA;you can destroy the seven worlds if you&#xA;are so minded. Listen, you can easily kill&#xA;Bharata and his army, but there is a thing&#xA;to consider before you set to work.&#xA;Disobeying and disgracing our father and&#xA;killing our brother and earning infinite&#xA;obloquy, what good shall we gain by&#xA;battling for and winning the kingdom?&#xA;What we gain by killing our kinsfolk will&#xA;be like food with which is mixed poison.&#xA;Why and for whom do we seek wealth&#xA;and kingdom? Is it not for the sake of&#xA;others, whose joy is our own? Who would&#xA;want to acquire a kingdom by wrong&#xA;means? And what joy is there in a&#xA;kingdom which you cannot share with&#xA;those you love? Truly I tell you, I will&#xA;never look at wealth and power that you&#xA;and Bharata and Satrughna cannot enjoy&#xA;with me. I know why Bharata is coming&#xA;here now and I will tell you. He knows the&#xA;way of dharma. He is coming here to give&#xA;the kingdom to me. If he had been in&#xA;Ayodhya instead of in the far-away land&#xA;of his uncle he would have dissuaded&#xA;Kaikeyi, and saved our father from the&#xA;great sorrow which has befallen him. I am&#xA;certain he is coming now to take me back&#xA;to the city. It is wrong of you to think ill&#xA;of Bharata and speak such harsh words&#xA;about him. If it is desire for the kingdom&#xA;that makes you so cruel in your suspicion,&#xA;tell me. I have only to tell Bharata to pass&#xA;it on to you, and I have no doubt he will&#xA;do it with pleasure.&amp;ldquo;Rama&#xA;said&#xA;this&#xA;laughing,&#xA;and&#xA;Lakshmana shrank into himself with&#xA;shame.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps our father, the King,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana said. &amp;quot; Is himself coming to&#xA;see us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After listening to Rama, he was&#xA;convinced that his fear was improper. He&#xA;wondered then why the army was&#xA;marching and thought that perhaps&#xA;Dasaratha was coming to visit them in the&#xA;forest and a large retinue followed the&#xA;King. The commentator remarks that&#xA;Lakshmana, realising his folly in having&#xA;spoken ill of Bharata, was trying by some&#xA;explanations to cover up his shame.&#xA;Rama cheered up Lakshmana saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it may be as you say. Thinking that&#xA;life in the forest was hard, the King might&#xA;have come to take us, and specially Sita,&#xA;back to the city. But then, we do not see&#xA;the King&amp;rsquo;s great white umbrella. But&#xA;whatever be the case, you should be&#xA;calm.&amp;rdquo; Lakshmana stood humbly with&#xA;folded hands by Rama.&#xA;Halting the army at some distance,&#xA;Bharata sent a few men to observe and&#xA;report on the place whence the smoke&#xA;rose. They brought the news that this was&#xA;the very spot described by Bharadwaja&#xA;and that the cottage was very probably&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s forest abode.&#xA;Bharata&#xA;started&#xA;forward&#xA;with&#xA;Satrughna, Vasishtha and Sumantra. As&#xA;they advanced, they saw indications that&#xA;the ashrama was habited. There was a&#xA;path that led to the river and the trees were&#xA;blazed on either side of it as though to&#xA;make it easy to find it in the dusk.&#xA;Presently they came to a cottage thatched&#xA;with leaves, near which were stacks of&#xA;faggots and the dry dung of deer and wild&#xA;buffaloes heaped for use in winter.&#xA;In the cottage, on the walls were&#xA;mighty bows and quivers full of deadly&#xA;arrows, swords which seemed to radiate&#xA;victory and other weapons all of&#xA;superlative excellence. They saw also,&#xA;spread out to dry on the branches of trees,&#xA;garments of bark. Bharata beheld all these&#xA;sure signs of his brothers&amp;rsquo; residence in the&#xA;hermitage with a swelling heart.&#xA;From inside came smoke from the&#xA;oblations of daily worship. Entering,&#xA;Bharata saw the altar with its blazing fire&#xA;and Rama himself seated by it with matted&#xA;locks, majestic, though in deer-skin and&#xA;bark, a ruler of the world, with his mighty&#xA;arms, breadth of chest and a countenance&#xA;made to command love and obedience. By&#xA;him were Sita and Lakshmana. He had&#xA;been thinking all the time of the infamy&#xA;that had gathered on his head, and&#xA;wondering what to say and what to do&#xA;when he met Rama.&#xA;But now when he saw Rama, he forgot&#xA;all this in the great love that surged within&#xA;him and submerged all other thoughts and&#xA;fears. He sprang forward to the spot where&#xA;Rama was seated. He could utter no word,&#xA;beyond &amp;ldquo;Brother,&amp;rdquo; and fell at his feet, and&#xA;sobbed. By this time, Sumantra and Guha&#xA;joined him.&#xA;Rama saw before him lying on the&#xA;ground Bharata with hands clasped in&#xA;supplication, with matted locks and in&#xA;garments of bark. With grief and fasting,&#xA;his body had grown lean and he was&#xA;tanned with fatigue and exposure. Rama&#xA;embraced him, and kissed him on the&#xA;head, and said: &amp;ldquo;Brother beloved, why did&#xA;you leave our father&amp;rsquo;s side and come all&#xA;this way into the forest? And why have&#xA;you grown so thin?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata was speechless. Rama put to&#xA;him the formal questions which members&#xA;of the royal family asked each other when&#xA;they met after an absence.&#xA;After an interval, Bharata gathered&#xA;strength and gave answer. &amp;ldquo;Why do you&#xA;question me about the kingdom, brother,&#xA;as though I were its ruler? Whatconnection is there between the kingdom&#xA;and myself? When you are the rightful&#xA;king, how could I call myself king or rule&#xA;over the land? My duty is to do you&#xA;humble service. It has not been given to&#xA;me to do it. The eldest son should bear the&#xA;burden of the kingdom. This is the law&#xA;and custom. Come with me to Ayodhya,&#xA;wear the crown and shower your grace on&#xA;our family and people. The old King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;work in the world is over and he has&#xA;entered Swarga. When you had left&#xA;Ayodhya for the forest and before I&#xA;returned from Kekaya the King gave up&#xA;his life, slain by the grief of separation&#xA;from you. Do not give way to sorrow.&#xA;Perform the obsequies of our father.&#xA;Thinking of you, he gave up his life. The&#xA;obsequies you perform will alone satisfy&#xA;his spirit.&amp;rdquo; Thus Bharata steadied himself&#xA;and spoke.&#xA;When Rama heard that his father was&#xA;dead, he fell down like a tree felled by an&#xA;axe. Bharata had no need to repeat before&#xA;Rama all the apologies and explanations&#xA;which he had to give to Kausalya, Guha&#xA;and Bharadwaja. Where was the need for&#xA;explanations when Rama set his eyes on&#xA;that grief-stricken body and that ravaged&#xA;face? Bharata, whose one concern was to&#xA;take Rama back to Ayodhya, spoke only&#xA;of this and not at all of himself.&#xA;The princes, with Sita and Sumantra&#xA;went to the river and offered libations for&#xA;the peace of the departed soul of the King.&#xA;After other customary ceremonies, the&#xA;princes returned to the cottage. They held&#xA;each other&amp;rsquo;s hands and relieved their&#xA;sorrow by loud lamentation.&#xA;In this episode, where Bharata meets&#xA;Rama, we read in Valmiki a long lecture&#xA;on the art of government, delivered by&#xA;Rama to his brother. Often in our epics,&#xA;we come across such long dissertations on&#xA;politics or morality. Modern fiction gives&#xA;high priority to narrative vigor, dramatic&#xA;suspense and surprise. In old works, in&#xA;addition to plenty of these qualities, there&#xA;were generous doses of didacticism.&#xA;It may be added here that even old&#xA;commentators noticed that the chapters of&#xA;this episode have got mixed up and&#xA;displaced in Valmiki. Kamban has of&#xA;course regularised and modernised the&#xA;narrative. In Tulsidas the meeting of&#xA;Rama and Bharata is steeped in bhakti and&#xA;there is no room for any complications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN it was known that the four&#xA;princes and the three queens were reunited&#xA;and could be seen together in one place, a&#xA;chorus of joy went up in the army and&#xA;retinue and they came surging forward to&#xA;witness that happy spectacle. They were&#xA;sure now that Rama would return to&#xA;Ayodhya and the people embraced one&#xA;another for the very joy.&#xA;The sage Vasishtha conducted the three&#xA;queens to the hut. On the way, they saw&#xA;the river Mandakini. When he showed&#xA;them the spot where the princes daily took&#xA;water for their use, Kausalya and Sumitra&#xA;broke down and sobbed. Said Kausalya:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;From this pool in the river, Sumitra,&#xA;your son takes water to the ashrama every&#xA;day. Lakshmana is prepared to do the&#xA;commonest task cheerfully for his brother.&#xA;He does not mind the weight of the water&#xA;pot on his princely shoulder.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They saw the spot where Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana poured out libations for their&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s Spirit. The darbha grass lay with&#xA;the ends facing south, beside the oil cake.&#xA;Kausalya clung to Sumitra and said: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;Sister! This is the food that the mightiest&#xA;kings have to be content with after death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They reached the hut. There they saw&#xA;the princes with faces clouded with&#xA;sorrow, seated under a thatched roof.&#xA;Unable to bear the sight, the royal mothers&#xA;sank to the floor.When Rama lifted Kausalya tip, she&#xA;stroked him with her flower-soft hands&#xA;and was at once sad and happy. She&#xA;embraced Sita and said: &amp;ldquo;My child,&#xA;Janaka&amp;rsquo;s daughter, daughter-in-law to the&#xA;King of Ayodhya, do you live in this hut&#xA;in the forest? O, faded lotus-flower! O,&#xA;golden image covered with dust! My heart&#xA;melts at the sight of you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama reverently touched the feet of&#xA;Vasishtha who seemed another Brihaspati,&#xA;the preceptor of the gods, come down to&#xA;earth, and then sat by his mother. Bharata&#xA;humbly sat apart facing Rama. The elders&#xA;surrounded them, eagerly awaiting what&#xA;Bharata would say and how Rama would&#xA;react.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bharata, why have you left your&#xA;kingly duties and come here in deer skin&#xA;and with matted locks?&amp;rdquo; asked Rama.&#xA;Bharata attempted to speak several times,&#xA;but at first could not get beyond the word&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Brother.&amp;rsquo; Then he pulled himself together&#xA;with a great effort and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sending you to the forest, but unable&#xA;to bear the pain, our father&amp;rsquo;s soul fled to&#xA;heaven. All the good my mother has got&#xA;from her evil plan has been that she has&#xA;become a sinner and a widow and is in&#xA;deep sorrow. Despised by the world, she&#xA;experiences hell on earth. Only you can&#xA;save us. Undo all the evil that has been&#xA;done and wipe off our tears by agreeing to&#xA;be crowned. It is to implore you for this&#xA;that we and the citizens and the army and&#xA;the widowed queens have come and are&#xA;all here waiting on your word. Grant us&#xA;our prayer. This alone will put an end to&#xA;our sorrow and re-establish the dharma of&#xA;our race. Without a rightful king, the land&#xA;is like a widow, desolate and helpless.&#xA;You must come back and make it happy&#xA;and secure. Like the full moon rising,&#xA;dispel our darkness. The ministers here&#xA;and I fall at your feet and beg of you. Do&#xA;not refuse, O, brother!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, the great Bharata, with&#xA;tear-filled eyes, clung to the feet of&#xA;Ramachandra.&#xA;Rama raised him from the ground and&#xA;embracing him said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Child, we were born in a noble family&#xA;and brought up in good ways. Neither you&#xA;nor I can do anything wrong. I see no fault&#xA;in you, my blameless brother! Do not feel&#xA;sad and do not speak unkind words about&#xA;your mother. It is not proper that we&#xA;should blame her. Surely our father had&#xA;the right to tell us what to do, aye, even to&#xA;decree banishment, just as he had the right&#xA;to order a coronation. Our duty is to honor&#xA;our father and our mother. How could I&#xA;disobey or question their command? Was&#xA;it for me to refuse my father&amp;rsquo;s command&#xA;that I should go to the forest? He gave you&#xA;kingship and he ordained for me life in the&#xA;forest. He certainly had the right to settle&#xA;the manner of our lives. What right do we&#xA;have to alter or reject his plans? Far from&#xA;being wrong, it is your duty to rule the&#xA;land. And I too shall do my duty and fulfil&#xA;our father&amp;rsquo;s last command by living&#xA;fourteen years in the Dandaka forest.&#xA;Failing to fulfil our father&amp;rsquo;s wish, can I&#xA;find contentment in the possession of the&#xA;whole world?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata repeatedly besought and&#xA;importuned Rama. Rama realised that&#xA;Bharata grieved that it was for his sake&#xA;injustice had been done and that he&#xA;endeavored to remove the blot.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not blame yourself,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Do&#xA;not think that all these things took place&#xA;for your sake. Destiny rules everything.&#xA;Give up your grief. Return to Ayodhya&#xA;and rule the kingdom. Let us each perform&#xA;the duties assigned to us by the father we&#xA;love and revere.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The people who watched the talk and&#xA;saw the determination of the prince were&#xA;filled with joy and sorrow in equalmeasure. Bharata&amp;rsquo;s affection and purity&#xA;filled them with pride and joy.&#xA;Rama told Bharata his unalterable&#xA;decision. &amp;ldquo;I cannot possibly disobey my&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s word. You will please me by not&#xA;persisting in trying to persuade me.&#xA;Satrughna is there to help you in ruling, as&#xA;Lakshmana is here to help me in forest&#xA;life. With Lakshmana by my side, I lack&#xA;nothing. Let us all four, brother, do our&#xA;other&amp;rsquo;s will.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The learned Jabali, one of the priests&#xA;who had accompanied Bharata, here&#xA;interposed a lesson on worldly wisdom for&#xA;the benefit of Rama. &amp;ldquo;You talk again and&#xA;again of your father&amp;rsquo;s command.&#xA;Dasaratha was a physical body which has&#xA;now rejoined the five elements. You talk&#xA;as though there is some continuing&#xA;relationship between that person who is&#xA;now no more and yourself. This is sheer&#xA;illusion. Why do you like the foolish&#xA;prating of dharma and seek to give up the&#xA;good fortune to which you were born?&#xA;Like a woman mourning with dishevelled&#xA;hair, the city of Ayodhya is plaintively&#xA;longing and waiting for your return. Go&#xA;back. Accept the crown. Enjoy life&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;pleasures. Listen to Bharata. Do not fail in&#xA;your proper duties.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This lecture angered Rama. He said&#xA;with much sharpness: &amp;ldquo;Sir, you seem to&#xA;set little value on truth and rectitude. Your&#xA;materialist talk fills me with such&#xA;abhorrence that I wonder that an&#xA;unbeliever like you should have been&#xA;tolerated in the court.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jabali hastened to explain that, far from&#xA;being an infidel, he had all his life been a&#xA;teacher of the Shastras and that he had&#xA;only spoken as he had done out of an&#xA;earnest wish to persuade Rama to return.&#xA;Vasishtha also intervened on his behalf&#xA;and that unlucky interlude came to an end.&#xA;Vasishtha then put the case for Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;return this way:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;On the whole, my opinion is that you&#xA;should return to Ayodhya and accept the&#xA;throne. Of course, your father&amp;rsquo;s command&#xA;also has to be considered, and reconciled&#xA;to this step. You have obeyed that&#xA;command at once and unhesitatingly, but&#xA;now a new situation has arisen. Bharata in&#xA;his helplessness, fearing infamy, has&#xA;sought shelter at your feet. How can you&#xA;spurn him? We all know that you love&#xA;him as your life. You never refuse those&#xA;who approach you for help. How then can&#xA;you deny it to Bharata now? Is it not your&#xA;life-principle to help those who seek&#xA;refuge at your feet?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Rama showed no signs of&#xA;relenting. Then, Bharata turned to&#xA;Sumantra and said, &amp;ldquo;My brother has no&#xA;pity for me. Please spread a bed of darbha&#xA;grass here for me. I shall take the pledge&#xA;of fasting unto death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sumantra hesitated and looked at&#xA;Rama. Then Bharata himself fetched and&#xA;spread the grass and sat on it.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My child, this is not right,&amp;rdquo; said Rama&#xA;firmly. &amp;ldquo;Rise. Go to Ayodhya and fulfil&#xA;your duties. Do not go against Kshatriya&#xA;dharma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata got up and as a last resort&#xA;appealed to the people who had&#xA;accompanied him, a representative crowd&#xA;of soldiers and citizens from Ayodhya:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O, citizens of Ayodhya! Why do you&#xA;stand mutely looking on? Do you not want&#xA;Rama to return? Why then are you silent?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The people answered: &amp;ldquo;Rama will not&#xA;swerve from truth. He will stand firm by&#xA;his father&amp;rsquo;s promise. He will not return to&#xA;Ayodhya. What is the use of pressing him&#xA;further?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama said, &amp;ldquo;Listen to them, brother.&#xA;They wish well by both of us. Virtue&#xA;dwells in their hearts.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Bharata said: &amp;ldquo;Here I am as guiltless as&#xA;Rama and a fit substitute for him. If the&#xA;King&amp;rsquo;s word should be fulfilled let me stayhere in the forest in place of Rama. Let&#xA;him fill my place and rule in Ayodhya.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama laughed and said: &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;procedure of exchange cannot apply here.&#xA;This is not trade or business for barter and&#xA;agreement. It is true that sometimes one&#xA;discharges the duties of another, when the&#xA;latter is too weak and unable to do it. But&#xA;how does it fit on this occasion? Can any&#xA;of you say that for life in the forest I have&#xA;no capacity but only Bharata has?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then the wise Vasishtha found a&#xA;solution for the problem in which&#xA;righteousness&#xA;struggled&#xA;with&#xA;righteousness as to which should be more&#xA;right. &amp;ldquo;O, Bharata, rule the kingdom under&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s authority and as his deputy. No&#xA;blame would attach to you then and the&#xA;pledge would be kept.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama took Bharata on his lap and told&#xA;him, &amp;ldquo;Brother, look on the kingdom as my&#xA;gift to you. Accept it and rule it as our&#xA;father wished.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A glory descended on Rama and&#xA;Bharata at that moment at they shone like&#xA;two suns.&#xA;Bharata said: &amp;ldquo;Brother, you are my&#xA;father and my God. Your least wish is my&#xA;dharma, Give me your sandals. That token&#xA;of yours shall reign in Ayodhya till you&#xA;return. And for fourteen years I shall stay&#xA;outside the city and discharge the King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;duties in your place, paying reverent&#xA;homage to your sandals. At the end of that&#xA;period, you will return and accept the&#xA;kingship.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So be it,&amp;rdquo; answered Rama.&#xA;He placed his feet on the sandals and&#xA;handed them to Bharata who prostrated&#xA;himself on the ground and accepted them&#xA;and put them on his head.&#xA;Bharata and his retinue turned back&#xA;towards Ayodhya. On the way, they met&#xA;the sage Bharadwaja and reported what&#xA;had happened. He blessed Bharata saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your virtue will be for ever&#xA;remembered. Are you not a son of the&#xA;solar race? As water flows downwards,&#xA;the virtue of your family runs its&#xA;inevitable course in you. Your father&#xA;Dasaratha is indeed happy. He is not dead&#xA;but lives again immortally in you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They met Guha again and crossed the&#xA;Ganga and reached Ayodhya. Bharata and&#xA;his followers entered Ayodhya. The city,&#xA;bereft of the King and Rama, appeared&#xA;desolate to Bharata. It seemed to be&#xA;enveloped in the darkness of a moonless&#xA;night. When he returned in haste from&#xA;Kekaya, he had entered the city in fatigue&#xA;and shapeless fear and suspense; but today&#xA;he entered it again fully realising all the&#xA;tragedy.&#xA;He remembered the past and thought of&#xA;the present and grieved afresh. He went to&#xA;the palace and took the queens to their&#xA;desolate apartments. He went to the&#xA;assembly hall, and said: &amp;ldquo;Great is my&#xA;sorrow. But I shall bear it. I shall stay in&#xA;Nandigrama and carry out my tasks as I&#xA;have&#xA;promised&#xA;Rama.&#xA;Make&#xA;all&#xA;arrangements for this purpose.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This was done and he solemnly&#xA;announced in the assembly, &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;kingdom is Rama&amp;rsquo;s. For the time being, he&#xA;has asked me to be in charge. In my&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s place I have installed his sandals.&#xA;Deriving my authority from them I shall&#xA;do my work as king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly,&#xA;Bharata&#xA;stayed&#xA;in&#xA;Nandigrama and with the help of&#xA;ministers ruled the kingdom as a religious&#xA;duty until Rama should return after&#xA;completing his forest life. And indeed, is&#xA;it not the law laid down in Scripture that&#xA;one should serve the world unselfishly&#xA;and without attachment, leaving the fruit&#xA;of one&amp;rsquo;s work at the feet of the Lord?&#xA;Rama did his penance in the forest for&#xA;fourteen years and all the time Bharata toodid his penance at Nandigrama near&#xA;Ayodhya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOT far from Chitrakuta was an&#xA;outpost of the Rakshasas, called&#xA;Janasthana, in charge of a famous warrior&#xA;named Khara, who was a brother of&#xA;Ravana. From this station, fierce&#xA;Rakshasas ranged the forest round,&#xA;molesting the rishis in their isolated&#xA;ashramas. They made life so insecure that&#xA;the rishis abandoned their hermitages in&#xA;the Chitrakuta region in spite of all that&#xA;Rama could do to dissuade them.&#xA;After Bharata&amp;rsquo;s departure Rama was&#xA;not quite happy in Chitrakuta. The face of&#xA;his&#xA;beloved&#xA;brother&#xA;tearful&#xA;with&#xA;disappointment and the sad drooping form&#xA;of his widowed mother were ever before&#xA;his mind&amp;rsquo;s eye. Now that the going away&#xA;of the rishis had deprived him of even&#xA;their companionship, the lonely hut was&#xA;so full of sad memories that he made up&#xA;his mind to seek some other resting place&#xA;in the Dandaka forest.&#xA;So they left Chitrakuta and proceeded&#xA;to the hermitage of Atri, a rishi who knew&#xA;the country, to seek his advice as to where&#xA;they might establish themselves. They&#xA;were most affectionately received and Sita&#xA;won the heart of Atri&amp;rsquo;s wife, the saintly&#xA;Anasuya. Anasuya delighted at finding in&#xA;Sita a perfect embodiment of wifely&#xA;virtues, blessed her and presented her with&#xA;beautiful&#xA;garments&#xA;and&#xA;auspicious&#xA;cosmetics that set out the charms of lovely&#xA;young wives.&#xA;Anasuya was the embodiment of pure&#xA;womanhood and her gifts added beauty&#xA;and inner strength to Sita. She received&#xA;the gifts and said: &amp;ldquo;My Lord the prince&#xA;loves me with the love of a mother and a&#xA;father. I am indeed blessed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then they made inquiries concerning&#xA;the way and resumed their journey.&#xA;Walking, through the great Dandaka&#xA;forest, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana reached&#xA;a spot where many rishis lived. Even as&#xA;they approached the place, they saw the&#xA;sacrificial materials, bark garments and&#xA;deerskins spread out to dry and they knew&#xA;it was a colony of holy men.&#xA;The place was beautiful to look at.&#xA;Birds and animals moved about with the&#xA;freedom from fear born of affectionate&#xA;familiarity with their human neighbors.&#xA;Ripe fruits hung from the trees. The&#xA;beautiful sound of Vedic chanting was&#xA;heard.&#xA;As they came near, they saw the&#xA;radiant faces of the rishis. They welcomed&#xA;Rama. &amp;ldquo;O, King! You are our protector,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;they said. &amp;ldquo;Whether we are in the town or&#xA;in the forest, you are our king.&amp;rdquo; And they&#xA;gave the new comers all they needed and&#xA;a place in which to rest.&#xA;The following morning, the three took&#xA;leave of the rishis and re-entered the&#xA;forest, which was now denser than before&#xA;and there were tigers and other wild&#xA;animals. They proceeded slowly and&#xA;cautiously.&#xA;Suddenly, a gigantic form distorted like&#xA;a broken fragment of a hill rushed at them&#xA;making a blood-curdling noise. It was a&#xA;man-eating rakshasa and his roar was like&#xA;thunder. He was unutterably ugly and the&#xA;tiger-skin he wore was covered with blood&#xA;and gobbets of flesh of the slaughtered&#xA;beast were sticking to it still.&#xA;The corpses of three lions and the head&#xA;of an elephant recently slain were impaled&#xA;and strung in a row on the great spear&#xA;which he shook menacingly at them.&#xA;The rakshasa lifted his weapon, roared&#xA;horribly and, springing forward lifted Sita&#xA;and as he held her, shouted at the princes:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you, little fellows? How dare&#xA;you enter this forest? You look young but&#xA;wear matted locks and bark garments.&#xA;You have disguised yourselves asascetics; yet you carry bows and arrows,&#xA;and go about with this woman by your&#xA;side. Whom are you trying to cheat? Are&#xA;you not ashamed of yourselves? You are&#xA;besmirching the good name of the rishis&#xA;by your conduct, you hypocrites! Know&#xA;that I am Viradha himself. The flesh of&#xA;rishis is my daily food. I shall have this&#xA;lovely damsel for my wife, do you&#xA;understand? I shall now drink your blood,&#xA;you villains!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Held in his grasp, Sita trembled with&#xA;fear. Rama lost his usual self-control and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, this is unbearable.&#xA;Kaikeyi must have known all this when&#xA;she sent us to the forest!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama was bewildered and did not&#xA;know how to meet the Rakshasa. But&#xA;Lakshmana, hissing like an angry snake,&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Rama, you are strong like Indra&#xA;and, with me by your side, you should not&#xA;talk dejectedly. Look at what my bow and&#xA;arrow can do. The earth will presently&#xA;drink this monster&amp;rsquo;s blood. My wrath&#xA;which was denied outlet at Ayodhya, I&#xA;shall now direct on this monster, and&#xA;shatter him as Indra did the winged&#xA;mountains of yore. I shall attack this&#xA;creature and slay him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Viradha roared again: &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&#xA;Tell me at once.&amp;rdquo; Rama&amp;rsquo;s mind now&#xA;cleared. His face glowed with courage and&#xA;calmly he said: &amp;ldquo;We are princes of the&#xA;Ikshvaku race. We have come to live in&#xA;the forest. May we know who you are?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasa answered. &amp;ldquo;And so, you&#xA;are the sons of Dasaratha, are you? My&#xA;father&amp;rsquo;s name is Jaya. And I am known&#xA;among rakshasas as Viradha. You puny&#xA;kshatriyas carrying arms, what can you&#xA;and your ridiculous weapons do to me? I&#xA;have secured a boon from Brahma that no&#xA;weapon can hurt me. Leave this girl here&#xA;and run away, if you wish to save your&#xA;lives.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s eyes grew red with anger. &amp;ldquo;It is&#xA;time for you to go to Yama,&amp;rdquo; he said and&#xA;bent his bow and shot a sharp arrow at the&#xA;monster. It pierced his body and emerged&#xA;red with blood, glistening like fire, and&#xA;fell on the earth beyond. But the rakshasa&#xA;was not killed. Enraged by the pain, he&#xA;placed Sita on the ground, and lifting his&#xA;spear and opening his mouth wide rushed&#xA;towards Rama and Lakshmana. The&#xA;princes sent a shower of arrows at him.&#xA;The arrows stuck so thick on his body that&#xA;he bristled all over like a gigantic&#xA;porcupine.&#xA;The rakshasa however laughed and&#xA;shook his limbs, and down fell all the&#xA;darts. He straightened himself and lifted&#xA;his spear again. Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;with two arrows broke the spear and&#xA;rushed at him sword in hand. But he lifted&#xA;them both up with his hands and put them&#xA;on his shoulders and strode off into the&#xA;forest. Sita saw them disappear in the&#xA;darkness of the jungle and wept loud.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana, seated one on&#xA;each shoulder, knowing that weapons&#xA;could not kill him, wrenched off his arms&#xA;and threw them down. They then attacked&#xA;him with their hands and feet. Still they&#xA;could not kill him on account of Brahma&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;boon, but the agony of his wounds was so&#xA;great that he howled with it. Unfortunately&#xA;for him he had asked for immunity from&#xA;slaughter, but not from pain.&#xA;The brothers threw down the exhausted&#xA;monster and Rama planted his foot on his&#xA;neck to prevent him from rising.&#xA;The touch of Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet cleared the&#xA;mist in which the curse incurred in a&#xA;previous&#xA;birth&#xA;had&#xA;shrouded&#xA;his&#xA;understanding, and in the sudden light of&#xA;recollection he joined his hands and said&#xA;humbly, &amp;ldquo;Your feet have touched me,&#xA;Lord, and my eyes are opened. I have&#xA;realised who you are. I am under a curse,&#xA;but you can save me. I am not a rakshasaby birth, but a Gandharva. The boon I&#xA;secured prevents my liberation. If you&#xA;could somehow kill me, I shall recover&#xA;my original form and go to heaven.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;smashed him without weapons and buried&#xA;him in a pit they dug in the earth. And the&#xA;rakshasa returned to the world of&#xA;Gandharvas.&#xA;Then the princes went back to the place&#xA;where Sita stood terrified and told her all&#xA;that happened.&#xA;They proceeded to the ashrama of&#xA;Sarabhanga. Indra was there with other&#xA;gods, talking to the rishi. Knowing that&#xA;Rama had arrived, he cut short his talk&#xA;and went away. Then Rama, with his&#xA;brother and wife, approached the rishi and&#xA;humbly saluted him.&#xA;The old ascetic said: &amp;ldquo;It is for you I&#xA;have been waiting. It is time for me to&#xA;leave the body but my wish was to see&#xA;you first. And so I have been waiting.&#xA;Now my desire is fulfilled, I pass on to&#xA;you all the merit of my penances.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama answered: &amp;ldquo;My Lord, should I&#xA;not earn my own merit? How can I&#xA;receive what you have earned? I have&#xA;renounced everything to live in the forest.&#xA;Advise me where I can best find an abode&#xA;in the forest and send me forth with your&#xA;blessing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The rishi knew the secret of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;avatar and told him: &amp;ldquo;Learn from the sage&#xA;Sutikshna where in the forest you should&#xA;dwell.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Sarabhanga kindled a fire and&#xA;entered it. The gross body perished in the&#xA;flames and a youthful ethereal form rose&#xA;from the pyre and floated up the heavens.&#xA;When the rishis of that forest heard the&#xA;news of Viradha&amp;rsquo;s death they came to&#xA;Rama and surrounded him. &amp;ldquo;It is our good&#xA;fortune, O King,&amp;rdquo; they said, &amp;ldquo;that you&#xA;have come to dwell in this region.&#xA;Hereafter, we shall perform our penance&#xA;untroubled by rakshasas. Look at those&#xA;bones scattered all round. They are the&#xA;remains of ascetics killed and eaten by the&#xA;rakshasas. The rishis on the banks of&#xA;Pampa and Mandakini live in constant&#xA;fear of their lives from these man-eating&#xA;monsters. The King&amp;rsquo;s duty from which he&#xA;may not fail without sin is to protect his&#xA;subjects. Just as householders pay taxes, a&#xA;share of the merit of our penances goes to&#xA;the King&amp;rsquo;s benefit. You are radiant like&#xA;Indra, king of the gods. Protect us from&#xA;this persecution of the rakshasas. You are&#xA;our only refuge.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama answered: &amp;ldquo;I am bound, O great&#xA;ones, to obey your command. I gave up&#xA;kingship and came to the forest in&#xA;obedience to my father&amp;rsquo;s wish. If in&#xA;discharging my duty as a son I can also&#xA;serve you and do some good, I shall count&#xA;myself twice blessed. I shall stay in the&#xA;forest and destroy the rakshasas and free&#xA;you from trouble. Shed your fear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s promise of help gave relief and&#xA;joy to the rishis. Rama, Lakshmana and&#xA;Sita then proceeded towards the ashrama&#xA;of Sutikshna. They came to a big hill&#xA;surrounded by a thick forest which they&#xA;entered. There they saw bark garments&#xA;drying in the sun and a little later came&#xA;upon the old rishi himself.&#xA;Saluting him, the prince said: &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;name is Rama, O holy sage. I have come&#xA;to have darshan of you. I pray for your&#xA;blessing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sage rose and embraced him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Welcome, defender of dharma. My&#xA;ashrama is fit up by your presence. It is&#xA;now yours. When I heard you had left&#xA;Ayodhya and taken up your abode at&#xA;Chitrakuta, I knew you would come here,&#xA;and have lived in hope of seeing you. Else&#xA;I would have long ago given up this body.&#xA;The merit I have accumulated I now pass&#xA;on to you. Take it for yourself, yourbrother and the princess.&amp;rdquo; The sage&amp;rsquo;s face&#xA;was bright with the light of long holy life.&#xA;It was the custom of the rishis thus to&#xA;offer their acquired merit to those who&#xA;came as their guests. From Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;answer, we can see how such courtesies&#xA;were to be received.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O sage, I must earn merit by my own&#xA;good deeds. With your blessing, I still&#xA;hope to do so. I wish to dwell in the&#xA;forest. The sage Sarabhanga directed me&#xA;here to receive your blessing and seek&#xA;your instructions as to where I could build&#xA;a home for the rest of my stay in the&#xA;forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The rishi&amp;rsquo;s face was bright with joy and&#xA;he said meaningfully: &amp;ldquo;You may live in&#xA;this ashrama. There are many rishis living&#xA;round about. The forest is full of fruit and&#xA;roots. But evil beasts are abroad molesting&#xA;the rishis and obstructing their penance.&#xA;The sages are unable to bear this trouble.&#xA;But for this, the place is good.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The prince understood what the sage&#xA;meant to convey. He bent and strung his&#xA;bow and said: &amp;ldquo;Holy sage! I shall destroy&#xA;these evil-doers. My bow is strong and&#xA;sharp are my arrows. It is not proper that&#xA;we should dwell in this ashrama. It may&#xA;interrupt your penance. We shall find a&#xA;place for ourselves in the neighborbood.&#xA;Permit us to do so.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;That night they stayed in the sage&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;ashrama as his guests, The following&#xA;morning, the three got up and bathed in&#xA;the cool water fragrant with flowers, lit&#xA;the sacrificial fire, performed their&#xA;worship and touched the feet of the sage.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;By your grace, we spent a good night.&#xA;We desire to see the other rishis in the&#xA;region and receive their blessings. It is&#xA;good to set out before the sun grows hot.&#xA;Pray, give us leave to go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sage embraced the princes and&#xA;blessed them, saying: &amp;ldquo;Visit the good&#xA;rishis in the Dandaka forest. They have all&#xA;gone through great austerities and&#xA;obtained divine powers. The forest is&#xA;indeed beautiful with deer and birds and&#xA;lotus-filled tanks, and the hills with&#xA;cascades and peacocks. Lakshmana, go&#xA;now with your brother and with Sita.&#xA;Come to this ashrama whenever you feel&#xA;like it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The three walked round the sage&#xA;according to custom and took leave of&#xA;him. Sita handed to them their swords,&#xA;bows and quivers and the princes set out,&#xA;more radiant than before because of the&#xA;great sage&amp;rsquo;s blessings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now begins the Aranya Kanda. The&#xA;poet begins with an episode that prepares&#xA;us for the misfortunes of Sita. A new&#xA;responsibility has been cast on the prince.&#xA;He is to destroy rakshasas who molest the&#xA;rishis in the Dandaka forest. A fear arose&#xA;in Sita&amp;rsquo;s heart like a shadow cast by events&#xA;to come.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why should you and Lakshmana who&#xA;are properly to be merely ascetics in the&#xA;forest&amp;rdquo; asked Sita of her beloved husband,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;take on yourselves this task of&#xA;protection? You have come here to fulfil a&#xA;promise of the late King. The duty of&#xA;protecting the rishis belongs to the ruler&#xA;who is actually reigning. It is not for you,&#xA;engaged in penance, to protect rishis. To&#xA;kill anyone, except in self-defence, is&#xA;opposed to the vow of ascetic life. But&#xA;you have rashly promised protection to&#xA;the rishis. I wonder where this will lead&#xA;us?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Sita argued in soft and&#xA;affectionate words while they were going&#xA;from Sage Sutikshna&amp;rsquo;s ashrama towards&#xA;some other ashrama in the Dandaka forest.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Bear with me, my Lord,&amp;rdquo; she said,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;for seeming to counsel you. I speak but&#xA;as a weak woman out of my infinite love&#xA;for you. You know what dharma is. But,&#xA;men, it is said, are driven by desire intothree kinds of sin: falsehood, lust and&#xA;violence. Falsehood is unthinkable in one&#xA;who for truth&amp;rsquo;s sake has renounced a&#xA;kingdom and is here in the forest. And as&#xA;for lust do I know that you will not allow&#xA;even the thought of another woman to&#xA;enter your mind. But I am afraid of the&#xA;third kind of sin. Should we kill one who&#xA;does not attack us? Whether it is a&#xA;rakshasa or anyone else, why should we&#xA;kill anyone who leaves us alone? You&#xA;were in a hurry, I feel, to give your word&#xA;to the rishis. To destroy the wicked is no&#xA;doubt the duty of a kshatriya but can that&#xA;duty still cling to you when you have&#xA;renounced the privileges that go with it,&#xA;and elected the life of a recluse in the&#xA;forest? The duties of kingship go with&#xA;actual status. Dressed in garments of bark&#xA;and with hair matted, you are now an&#xA;ascetic, pure and simple. Of course, you&#xA;know best. I am only asking you to think&#xA;well before undertaking anything.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s love and admiration of Sita&#xA;rose all the more for her is misgivings.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Indeed, my love,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;you speak&#xA;like a true daughter of Janaka. But, Sita,&#xA;did you not once say yourself that the&#xA;weapons borne by kshatriyas are for&#xA;protecting others? When helpless people&#xA;suffer persecution, how could a kshatriya&#xA;sit still? When we came here the sages&#xA;complained of their sufferings and&#xA;entreated our protection. They could not&#xA;endure the cruelties of the Rakshasas who&#xA;looked on them as so much meat and&#xA;made shambles of the hermitages. Did&#xA;they not show us a great heap of bones to&#xA;show what had been done? &amp;lsquo;You are the&#xA;king&amp;rsquo;s son,&amp;rsquo; they said. &amp;lsquo;Our troubles will&#xA;now end as darkness before the rising sun.&#xA;You are our only refuge.&amp;rsquo; Could we&#xA;princes hear their piteous appeal and&#xA;refrain from helping them? Every&#xA;kshatriya, everyone has to do his duty, not&#xA;the king alone. You are, of course,&#xA;solicitous for my safety. Even granting&#xA;that what you say is right, I have given my&#xA;word and I cannot go back. They said,&#xA;&amp;lsquo;You are our refuge,&amp;rsquo; and I have given my&#xA;word to protect them. A pledge thus given&#xA;cannot be withdrawn. What I have spoken&#xA;cannot now be unsaid. You and I must&#xA;tread together the path of dharma. How&#xA;can we differ?&amp;rdquo; Talking thus, they went&#xA;along the forest path.&#xA;This conversation occurs in the poem&#xA;like the cloud that precedes the storm. It is&#xA;the artistic creation of a changing&#xA;atmosphere and not a random casting up&#xA;of facile verses.&#xA;For ten years, Rama, Lakshmana and&#xA;Sita lived quietly among the rishis. In the&#xA;great Dandaka forest, there were a number&#xA;of ashramas where the rishis lived&#xA;practising their austerities and living their&#xA;lives of abnegation. The princes spent a&#xA;month in one ashrama, three months in a&#xA;second and perhaps a year in a third as&#xA;welcome and happy visitors.&#xA;The forest was indescribably beautiful,&#xA;with deer and bison, boars and elephants.&#xA;The birds, the trees, the creepers, the blue&#xA;waterlilies, all live again in the beauty of&#xA;Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s poetry.&#xA;Rama was very happy these ten years,&#xA;the joy of association with great and holy&#xA;men being added to his joy in the quiet&#xA;companionship of Lakshmana and Sita.&#xA;These ten years are disposed of in a small&#xA;chapter. Time happily spent seems short&#xA;and needs no length in recording.&#xA;When after ten years had thus passed,&#xA;the end of their forest life was&#xA;approaching, Rama wished to have&#xA;darshan of the sage Agastya who lived in&#xA;the south. The sage was, like&#xA;Vishwamitra, famous through the three&#xA;worlds. It used to be said that if all the&#xA;wisdom and spiritual merit between the&#xA;Himalayas and the Vindhyas were put on&#xA;one scale and Agastya sat on the other, thesouthern scale would go down by his&#xA;weight.&#xA;There is also the story of Agastya&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;service during the wedding of Siva and&#xA;Parvati. All the rishis had gone to Mount&#xA;Kailas for the great event. Agastya alone,&#xA;staying in the south, maintained the&#xA;balance of the earth. Once the Vindhya&#xA;Mountain steadily grew towards the&#xA;heavens and threatened to obstruct the&#xA;sun&amp;rsquo;s passage between the northern and&#xA;southern hemispheres.&#xA;The gods grew frightened and&#xA;approached Agastya for help. The Sage&#xA;stood before the mountain which bent low&#xA;in reverence before him. Then he blessed&#xA;it saving: &amp;ldquo;May you ever remain thus&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;and so the mountain stretches low and&#xA;long even now. So goes the story.&#xA;Two Rakshasas, Vatapi and Ilvala,&#xA;gave much trouble to the rishis. The&#xA;former had obtained a boon that no matter&#xA;into how many pieces his body was cut&#xA;up, they would all reunite and his body&#xA;would be whole and strong as before.&#xA;IIvala, disguised as a brahmana, would go&#xA;to the ashrama of one rishi after another&#xA;and say, &amp;ldquo;O Learned One! Go over to my&#xA;humble home and oblige me by accepting&#xA;the consecrated food prepared for my&#xA;manes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On no account, according to ancient&#xA;rule, could one refuse such an invitation.&#xA;The rishis therefore had to accept the&#xA;invitation. To them Ilvala served as food&#xA;his brother Vatapi cut up and cooked&#xA;lusciously and after the unsuspecting&#xA;guests had eaten the meat, the host would,&#xA;according to custom, ask the guests, &amp;ldquo;Are&#xA;you satisfied?&amp;rdquo; The answer would be&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes. We are content.&amp;rdquo; Then, Ilvala would&#xA;shout, &amp;ldquo;Vatapi Come out!&amp;rdquo; And at the call&#xA;of Ilvala, Vatapi reunited into life would&#xA;come out tearing the bowels of the guests.&#xA;Many rishis had to die in this way.&#xA;One day, Ilvala tried to play this trick&#xA;on Agastya. As usual, Vatapi entered&#xA;Agastya&amp;rsquo;s entrails as meat. Agastya of&#xA;course knew this, but he was a devotee of&#xA;Ganapati and had obtained the power to&#xA;digest the Rakshasa.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Are you satisfied?&amp;rdquo; asked Ilvala.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I am satisfied,&amp;rdquo; answered&#xA;Agastya.&#xA;IIvala shouted, &amp;ldquo;Vatapi, come out.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agastya, laughing, said, &amp;ldquo;Vatapi has&#xA;been digested, my host!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; cried Ilvala. &amp;ldquo;Have you killed&#xA;my brother?&amp;rdquo; And he rushed against&#xA;Agastya.&#xA;The Sage opened his eyes in&#xA;indignation and the rakshasa was reduced&#xA;to ashes. No rakshasas would thereafter&#xA;come near Agastya and he protected the&#xA;other sages also. Rama first went to the&#xA;ashrama of Agastya&amp;rsquo;s younger brother and&#xA;obtained his blessings before visiting&#xA;Agastya himself. Proceeding south and&#xA;approaching Agastya&amp;rsquo;s place, Rama&#xA;noticed the brightness of the whole region,&#xA;the birds and animals playing about&#xA;without fear and brahmanas gathering&#xA;flowers for worship.&#xA;He told Lakshmana to go in advance&#xA;and announce him to the sage. Lakshmana&#xA;met one of the disciples of the sage and&#xA;sent word through him: &amp;ldquo;Ramachandra,&#xA;son of Dasaratha, has come with his&#xA;brother and wife to seek the great sage&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;blessings.&#xA;Agastya warmly welcomed the princes.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;I heard of your having come to&#xA;dwell in Chitrakuta, and I was looking&#xA;forward to your visit. The end of your&#xA;exile is approaching. Stay here during&#xA;what remains of it in peace. This place is&#xA;free from the fear of rakshasas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama answered: &amp;ldquo;I am happy to&#xA;receive your blessing and I thank you for&#xA;your gracious welcome. But I have&#xA;promised protection to the rishis inDandaka and now that I have received&#xA;your blessings, I must return to that&#xA;forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Agastya answered: &amp;ldquo;What you say&#xA;is right.&amp;rdquo; Then the Sage gave to Rama the&#xA;bow made by Viswakarma for Vishnu and&#xA;an inexhaustible quiver, as well as a&#xA;sword. He blessed him saying, &amp;ldquo;Rama,&#xA;destroy the rakshasas with these weapons&#xA;which of yore Vishnu gave me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agastya advised the prince to spend the&#xA;rest of his exile at Panchavati.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May God bless you, O, Prince,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Agastya, &amp;ldquo;take good care of Sita who for&#xA;love of you cheerfully submits to&#xA;hardships to which she was not born or&#xA;accustomed. Women are by nature fond of&#xA;comfort and averse to hardship but no&#xA;such weakness is found in Sita. She is like&#xA;Arundhati.&#xA;Wherever&#xA;you&#xA;are,&#xA;Ramachandra, with Lakshmana and Sita&#xA;by your side, the place will be filled with&#xA;beauty. But Panchavati is itself a beautiful&#xA;spot and Sita will love to live there, secure&#xA;in the protection of you both. Fruit and&#xA;roots are there in abundance. Stay there on&#xA;the bank of the Godavari. The period of&#xA;your exile is coming to an end. You will&#xA;soon fulfil your father&amp;rsquo;s plighted word.&#xA;Like Yayati, Dasaratha is served by his&#xA;eldest son.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Princes and Sita, following&#xA;Agastya&amp;rsquo;s instruction, took the way to&#xA;Panchavati. On the way they met a huge&#xA;figure perched on a big tree. They took it&#xA;to be a Rakshasa.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; asked Rama in an&#xA;angry tone. The vulture however&#xA;answered in a voice full of mildness and&#xA;affection: &amp;ldquo;My child, I am your father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;aged friend.&amp;rdquo; Then he proceeded to tell his&#xA;story.&#xA;Jatayu was the brother of Sampati, the&#xA;son of Aruna the dawn-god, who was&#xA;brother to Garuda the great eagle-vehicle&#xA;of Vishnu.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;When you leave Sita alone&#xA;and go hunting in the forest, I shall be&#xA;looking after her safety.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The prince was pleased and accepted&#xA;the offer of the bird with gratitude. They&#xA;then proceeded on their journey.&#xA;Rama was thrilled by the beauty of&#xA;Panchavati and gratefully offered praise in&#xA;his thoughts to Agastya for recommending&#xA;the spot to them. He told Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;We&#xA;can build our ashrama and enjoy our stay&#xA;here for any length of time. Those hills are&#xA;near and yet not too near. Look at those&#xA;herds of deer. The trees with their flowers&#xA;and the sweetly singing birds, the river,&#xA;the clean sand, everything is beautiful.&#xA;Choose for us a good site and build a&#xA;cottage.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana did as he was told. He&#xA;constructed an ashrama.&#xA;Valmiki pauses here to explain the skill&#xA;and&#xA;swiftness&#xA;of&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;workmanship. He describes in detail how&#xA;the mud walls were raised and the&#xA;thatched roof was made. Rama admires&#xA;Lakshmana enthusiastically.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are more than a father to me,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said the prince shedding tears of love and&#xA;joy.&#xA;We, too, may pause to think how the&#xA;noble prince Lakshmana acquired this&#xA;skill. We may infer that in those days&#xA;education even of princes included a&#xA;knowledge of the realities of life and&#xA;development of manual skill such as could&#xA;enable one to collect materials in a forest&#xA;and put a neat cottage for oneself.&#xA;In the ashrama at Panchavati, Rama&#xA;and Sita lived happily, lovingly served by&#xA;Lakshmana.&#xA;One morning in early winter the three&#xA;went as usual to the Godavari for their&#xA;bath and to offer their morning prayers&#xA;and fetch water for the day&amp;rsquo;s needs. Theywalked conversing about the beauty of the&#xA;season. Lakshmana thought of Bharata&#xA;and how he would then be busy&#xA;performing the ceremonies appropriate to&#xA;the month.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;Bharata is entitled to live in&#xA;ease but he has taken on himself a life of&#xA;hardship because we live a life of hardship&#xA;in the forest. My heart is full of sorrow for&#xA;him. Even in this cold weather poor&#xA;Bharata no doubt eats sparingly and sleeps&#xA;on the bare floor. This cold morning he&#xA;too is probably walking towards the&#xA;Sarayu. How fortunate we are to have&#xA;such a noble brother! Pure in mind and&#xA;speech and conduct, renouncing all&#xA;pleasures, he lives a life of austerity for&#xA;our sake. He is exactly like our dear father&#xA;and quite the opposite of his mother. How&#xA;could so cruel a woman as Kaikeyi bear&#xA;so good a son?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama stopped him, saying: &amp;ldquo;Talk as&#xA;much as you like of Bharata and our&#xA;father, but stop condemning Kaikeyi. All&#xA;that you say of Bharata is true and my&#xA;thoughts too today go to him in love. How&#xA;long yet to see him again? When shall we&#xA;have that pleasure, Lakshmana? When&#xA;shall we four brothers live together again?&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s loving words are still sweetly&#xA;ringing in my ears.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus thinking longingly of home and&#xA;Bharata they bathed in the Godavari on&#xA;that early winter morning.&#xA;After offering oblations to their&#xA;ancestors and prayers to the sun, Rama&#xA;rose transfigured like the Lord Siva and&#xA;returned to the ashrama with Sita and&#xA;Lakshmana.&#xA;Their morning duties over, they sat&#xA;whiling the hours with wistful talk of old&#xA;days and tales of long ago.&#xA;While they were thus recapturing the&#xA;past in sweet companionship suddenly&#xA;there came a Rakshasa woman who saw&#xA;them. She was Surpanakha, Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;sister who was roaming the forest full of&#xA;the idle thoughts of well-fed ill-taught&#xA;youth. She was horribly ugly, but had the&#xA;magic power to assume any lovely form at&#xA;will. When she saw the godlike beauty of&#xA;Rama, she was filled with uncontrollable&#xA;desire for him and accosted him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you, dressed like an ascetic&#xA;but accompanied by a woman and&#xA;carrying warlike weapons and arrows?&#xA;Why are you here in the forest that&#xA;belongs to the Rakshasas? Speak the&#xA;truth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On such occasions it was the courtesy&#xA;of those days for the person accosted to&#xA;announce himself and recite his name, city&#xA;and history and inquire of the newcomer&#xA;concerning his or her family and the&#xA;purpose of the visit.&#xA;Rama began, &amp;ldquo;I am the eldest son of&#xA;the great King Dasaratha. My name is&#xA;Rama. This is my brother Lakshmana.&#xA;And this is my wife Sita. Obeying the&#xA;behests of my father and mother and in&#xA;fulfilment of dharma, I am now in the&#xA;forest. And now please announce who you&#xA;are. What is your family? You look like a&#xA;woman of the Rakshasa race. What is&#xA;your purpose in coming here?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She answered, &amp;ldquo;Have you heard of&#xA;Ravana, the heroic son of Visravas and&#xA;the king of the Rakshasas? I am his sister.&#xA;My name is Surpanakha. My brothers&#xA;Kumbhakarna and Vibhishana are also&#xA;renowned warriors. The lords of this&#xA;region, Khara and Dushana, are also my&#xA;brothers. They too are mighty men at arms&#xA;and wield great authority in these regions.&#xA;But I am not subject to their control, but&#xA;am a free person, free to do what I like&#xA;and please myself. Everybody in this&#xA;forest is, as a matter of fact, afraid of me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She said this to strengthen her wooing&#xA;position.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The moment I set eyes on you,&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;continued, &amp;ldquo;I fell in love with you. Youare now my husband. Why do you wander&#xA;around with this midget of a woman! I am&#xA;the mate worthy of you. Come with me.&#xA;Let us wander at will through the forest. I&#xA;can take what shape I please. Do not mind&#xA;this girl of yours. I shall cut her up in a&#xA;trice and dispose of her. Do not hesitate.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Under the influence of lust, she thought&#xA;in the manner of her race and prated thus.&#xA;All this amazed and amused Rama. He&#xA;smiled and said: &amp;ldquo;Oh beautiful one! Your&#xA;desire for me will end in trouble for you.&#xA;My wife is here with me. I do not care to&#xA;live the life of a man with two wives. But&#xA;my hefty brother here is untrammelled&#xA;with a wife, and is as good-looking as&#xA;myself. He is the proper husband for you.&#xA;Offer your hand to him and leave me&#xA;alone.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama said this, being confident that&#xA;Lakshmana would deal with Surpanakha&#xA;suitably.&#xA;The Rakshasi took Rama&amp;rsquo;s advice&#xA;seriously and approached Lakshmana&#xA;saying, &amp;ldquo;Oh, my hero, come with me. Let&#xA;us together wander at will in joy through&#xA;this Dandaka forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana entered into the humor of&#xA;the situation and said, &amp;ldquo;Do not be foolish.&#xA;He is trying to cheat you. What is your&#xA;status and what is mine? I am here a slave&#xA;to my brother, while you are a princess.&#xA;How could you become my wife and&#xA;accept the position of a slave&amp;rsquo;s slave?&#xA;Insist on Rama&amp;rsquo;s taking you as his second&#xA;wife. Do not mind Sita. Soon Rama will&#xA;prefer you to her and you will be happy&#xA;with him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Some critic might ask whether it was&#xA;proper thus to torment a woman,&#xA;especially a woman in love. But if we&#xA;exercise our imagination and have before&#xA;us a monster of ugliness we can&#xA;understand the situation. It is true that she&#xA;could assume any charming form she&#xA;chose, but in the intoxication of lust, she&#xA;seems to have omitted even this&#xA;allurement.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This ugly, corpulent and paunchy&#xA;Rakshasi, with leering eyes blood-shot&#xA;with lust, her red hair all dishevelled and&#xA;her voice hoarse with passion, accosted&#xA;the handsome, beautifully built and&#xA;smiling Rama&amp;rdquo;, says Valmiki. The Tamil&#xA;poet Kamban varies the situation by&#xA;making Surpanakha assume a lovely&#xA;shape from the outset.&#xA;Impelled by brute passion, the&#xA;Rakshasi did as she was told by&#xA;Lakshmana and went again to Rama. She&#xA;thought and acted like a Rakshasi for she&#xA;knew no other way of life.&#xA;The sight of Sita enraged her. &amp;ldquo;It is this&#xA;wretched little insect that stands between&#xA;you and me. How could you love this girl&#xA;without a waist? Look. I shall finish her&#xA;off this instant. I cannot live without you.&#xA;Once I have put her out of the way, you&#xA;and I shall live together happily.&amp;rdquo; Saying&#xA;this, she sprang on Sita.&#xA;Rama intervened just in time to save&#xA;Sita. The farce had gone too far and&#xA;threatened to become a tragedy. Rama&#xA;shouted to Lakshmana, &amp;ldquo;Look, I have just&#xA;been able to save Sita. Attend to this&#xA;monster and teach her a lesson.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana at once took up his sword&#xA;and maimed Surpanakha and drove her&#xA;out. Disgraced and mutilated, Surpanakha&#xA;uttered a loud wail and disappeared into&#xA;the forest.&#xA;Bleeding and mad with pain and rage,&#xA;she flung herself on the ground before&#xA;Khara, as he sat in state with his&#xA;colleagues. Yelling with anguish, she&#xA;related the story of her wrongs. The scorn&#xA;and mutilation she had suffered was an&#xA;insult to the Rakshasa race which only&#xA;blood could efface.&#xA;She said: &amp;ldquo;Look at me. Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana have done this and they arestill alive and roaming in your domain.&#xA;And you sit here doing nothing.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Khara stood up and said: &amp;ldquo;My dear&#xA;sister, what is all this? I understand&#xA;nothing. Calm yourself and tell me what&#xA;has happened. Who dared to do this thing&#xA;to you and is he in this forest? Who is he&#xA;that wants to become food for crows and&#xA;vultures? Who has stirred up the black&#xA;cobra? Who is that fool? Where is he?&#xA;Tell me, and he shall die at once. The&#xA;earth is thirsty for his blood. Stand up and&#xA;tell me everything as it happened.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Two handsome young men,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Surpanakha, &amp;ldquo;have come into the forest,&#xA;dressed like ascetics and accompanied by&#xA;a girl. They say they are the sons of&#xA;Dasaratha. These two together, making an&#xA;excuse of the girl attacked me and have&#xA;hurt me thus shamefully. I am thirsting for&#xA;the blood of these villains. Slay them first.&#xA;Everything else can wait.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Khara ordered his generals: &amp;ldquo;Go at&#xA;once, slay these men and bring their&#xA;lifeless bodies. Drag hither the woman&#xA;also. Delay not.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fourteen generals set out to do his&#xA;bidding.&#xA;In Kamban&amp;rsquo;s Ramayana, Surpanakha is&#xA;delineated as having come in the shape of&#xA;a beautiful young woman, entirely human,&#xA;who tried to tempt Rama. Kamban departs&#xA;widely from Valmiki in this episode and&#xA;he makes a beautiful episode of it as will&#xA;be seen in the next chapter.&#xA;There are some people who pose as&#xA;critics of our holy books and traditions&#xA;saying, &amp;ldquo;This hero killed a woman. He&#xA;insulted and injured a woman who offered&#xA;him her love. He killed Vali from behind,&#xA;rather than face him and accept honorable&#xA;defeat. He unjustly banished Sita to the&#xA;forest at the end of all the adventures. If&#xA;the banishment of Sita was not unjust and&#xA;if he rightly suspected Sita&amp;rsquo;s fidelity, why&#xA;then, we too, must suspect her fidelity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All such criticism is based on a&#xA;mentality&#xA;of&#xA;hatred.&#xA;We&#xA;have&#xA;unfortunately plenty of barren, heartless&#xA;cleverness, devoid of true understanding.&#xA;Let those who find faults in Rama see&#xA;faults, and if these critics faultlessly&#xA;pursue dharma and avoid in their own&#xA;lives the flaws they discover in Rama, the&#xA;bhaktas of Sri Rama will indeed welcome&#xA;it with joy. If they exhibit the virtues of&#xA;Rama and add to these more virtues and&#xA;greater flawlessness, who can complain?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAMA and Lakshmana drove out&#xA;Surpanakha, as one takes a stick and&#xA;drives out a donkey straying into a garden.&#xA;Such is the brief and simple treatment of&#xA;this incident by Valmiki.&#xA;Kamban, the Tamil poet, however,&#xA;deals with it more elaborately and has&#xA;made a number of changes in the story.&#xA;Sitting on the riverbank, Rama watched&#xA;a swan walking and then looked at Sita,&#xA;also walking. Noting the similarity in the&#xA;gait, Rama was pleased and smiled. Sita,&#xA;for her part, observed an elephant&#xA;returning from the river and, reminded of&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s gait, smiled. Thus in Panchavati,&#xA;beside the river Godavari, love flowed&#xA;smoothly between the banks of dharma.&#xA;Just then fate conspired with lust to drag&#xA;Surpanakha to the presence of Rama. The&#xA;Lord Vishnu had left the Ocean of Milk&#xA;and taken birth as Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s son, to rid&#xA;the earth of the enemies of the gods. But&#xA;how was Surpanakha to know this?&#xA;Beholding the beauty of his person, she&#xA;wondered: &amp;ldquo;Is this Manmatha or Indra or&#xA;Siva or Vishnu? But Manmatha has no&#xA;body. Indra has a thousand eyes and Siva&#xA;has third eye in the forehead, and Vishnu&#xA;has four arms; so he cannot be Indra, Siva&#xA;or Vishnu. Perhaps, after all, this is&#xA;Manmatha who has recovered his body&#xA;through penance, after it had been reduced&#xA;to ashes by Siva&amp;rsquo;s wrath. If it beManmatha, why should this handsome&#xA;hero still perform penance? Why should&#xA;this lotus-eyed youth waste his time in&#xA;tapas?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So she stood there wondering,&#xA;watching, unable to turn her eyes away.&#xA;She thought, &amp;ldquo;My own form would fill&#xA;him with disgust. I shall change my&#xA;appearance and then approach him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She transformed herself into a beautiful&#xA;young woman and appeared before him&#xA;like the full moon. Her slender frame was&#xA;like a golden creeper climbing up the&#xA;Kalpaka tree in Heaven. Her lovely lips&#xA;and teeth were matched by her fawn-like&#xA;eyes.&#xA;Her gait was that of a peacock. Her&#xA;anklets made music as she came near.&#xA;Rama looked up and his eyes beheld this&#xA;creature of ravishing beauty. She bowed&#xA;low and touched his feet. Then she&#xA;withdrew a little with modesty shading&#xA;her eyes.&#xA;Rama welcomed her, imagining that&#xA;she was a visitor from some distant place&#xA;and inquired: &amp;ldquo;Which is your place? What&#xA;is your name? Who are your kinsfolk?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She answered: &amp;ldquo;I am the daughter of&#xA;the grandson of Brahma. Kubera is a&#xA;brother of mine. Another is Ravana,&#xA;conqueror of Kailasa. I am a maiden and&#xA;my name is Kamavalli. And what is your&#xA;purpose in coming here? It is not proper&#xA;for a woman to speak out the trouble in&#xA;her mind. And yet I suppose I must speak&#xA;it out. The God of Love has invaded my&#xA;heart. You can and should save me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She paused. Rama remained silent.&#xA;And she went on.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You may wed me with Gandharva&#xA;rites. You know it is permitted for lovers&#xA;to come together in this manner. Once we&#xA;are joined in this way, not only will&#xA;happiness be ours, but friendship between&#xA;you and my brother, the great Ravana,&#xA;will follow. You are alone in this forest&#xA;and the Rakshasas will molest you. Even&#xA;if you do not provoke them, they will give&#xA;you trouble because you are dressed as an&#xA;ascetic. If you marry me, you will be free&#xA;from all this danger. Not only that, my&#xA;powerful people will be ready to serve&#xA;you in all ways. Consider this well.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus she pleaded for the fulfilment of&#xA;her desire, citing authority and appealing&#xA;to Rama&amp;rsquo;s self-interest also.&#xA;Rama laughed revealing his beautiful&#xA;pearly teeth. Just then, Sita was coming&#xA;towards them through the plants and&#xA;creepers, herself looking like another&#xA;creeper. Surpanakha saw and marvelled at&#xA;her loveliness.&#xA;Not&#xA;knowing whom she was,&#xA;Surpanakha angered by lust, told Rama:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This girl is a Rakshasi in human form.&#xA;She has come to deceive you. Beware of&#xA;her. Demonic is not her real form. She is a&#xA;Rakshasi that eats raw meat. Throw her&#xA;out. Have nothing to do with her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama laughed again. &amp;ldquo;You are indeed&#xA;wise,&amp;rdquo; said he. &amp;ldquo;You have found out the&#xA;truth about her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Meanwhile, Sita had come and stood&#xA;by Rama. Surpanakha could not&#xA;understand what Rama was laughing for.&#xA;In her lust, she had quite lost her wits. She&#xA;hissed at Sita: &amp;ldquo;Why do you approach this&#xA;hero of mine, oh Rakshasi? Go away from&#xA;here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita, bewildered and afraid, hung on&#xA;the prince&amp;rsquo;s shoulder, and she then seemed&#xA;like a lightning flash hugging a rain-&#xA;bearing cloud.&#xA;Rama now saw that the joke had gone&#xA;too far and said: &amp;ldquo;Dear lady, please stop,&#xA;lest my brother should hear you. He is&#xA;quick-tempered and terrible when angry. I&#xA;advise you to go back quickly the way&#xA;you came.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, Rama took Sita&#xA;with him and went into the hermitage.&#xA;The fire of her desire unquenched, the&#xA;Rakshasi spent the night somewhere,somehow. In the morning, she thought: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;shall die if I do not get this man. So long&#xA;as this girl is with him, he will never come&#xA;near me. I must contrive to carry her off&#xA;and put her away somewhere and then I&#xA;may secure his love.&amp;rdquo; Thus resolved, she&#xA;came again to the ashrama.&#xA;Rama had gone to the river for his&#xA;morning ablutions and prayer and Sita&#xA;was alone in the ashrama. Surpanakha&#xA;reckoned this was her chance to carry her&#xA;off. She did not notice that Lakshmana&#xA;was in the wood nearby. She rushed&#xA;towards Sita. Lakshmana shouted and&#xA;sprang on the Rakshasi. Catching hold of&#xA;her hair, he kicked her and drew his&#xA;sword.&#xA;Surpanakha&#xA;when&#xA;attacked&#xA;resumed her own shape and at tacked&#xA;Lakshmana. Lakshmana easily caught&#xA;hold of her and mutilated her and drove&#xA;her off.&#xA;Surpanakha ran into the forest,&#xA;bleeding and loudly appealing to her&#xA;kinsfolk: &amp;ldquo;Oh, brother Khara! Oh, brother&#xA;Ravana! Oh, Indrajit! Oh, kings of the&#xA;Rakshasa race! Are you all asleep? A&#xA;mere man has insulted me and cut off my&#xA;nose. Do you not hear my lamentations?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This is Kamban&amp;rsquo;s version of the&#xA;episode. Surpanakha approaches and tries&#xA;to attract Rama, hiding her true form and&#xA;appearing like a beautiful human girl. This&#xA;variation is supported in a way by&#xA;Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s description of Surpanakha as&#xA;Kamarupini, that is, one able to assume&#xA;what form she liked.&#xA;The Tamil poet appears to have felt&#xA;something wrong or wanting in Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;story and has woven an episode showing&#xA;how bestial passion works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ACCOMPANIED by the fourteen&#xA;generals of Khara, Surpanakha came back&#xA;to Rama&amp;rsquo;s ashrama, determined to avenge&#xA;herself and drink the blood of the princes.&#xA;Pointing to the two young men, she told&#xA;her escort, &amp;ldquo;Look, there stand the men&#xA;who insulted and mutilated me. Slay them&#xA;immediately.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama understood the situation at once&#xA;and told Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;Take care of Sita&#xA;for a while, while I deal with those&#xA;fellows.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, he took up his bow.&#xA;Following the prevailing rules of war,&#xA;Rama announced himself to Khara&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;generals and said, &amp;ldquo;Tell us the reason that&#xA;you come here. Know that we are here in&#xA;the forest at the bidding of the rishis for&#xA;the purpose of destroying their enemies. If&#xA;you wish to escape with life, leave us&#xA;alone.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But the Rakshasas wanted not peace,&#xA;but war. And the battle began. It did not&#xA;take long for Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrows to annihilate&#xA;the Rakshasa generals.&#xA;Once&#xA;again,&#xA;lamenting&#xA;loudly,&#xA;Surpanakha went to Khara. The&#xA;destruction of the powerful detachment he&#xA;had sent was inconceivable. He could not&#xA;believe it. He sought to soothe his&#xA;disturbed sister with soft words.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have sent warriors unconquerable,&#xA;each one like Yama. They must have by&#xA;now fulfilled their mission. Why do you&#xA;weep&amp;rsquo;? Why need you bewail while I am&#xA;here?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Surpanakha rose, and wiping the tears&#xA;from her eyes, said: &amp;ldquo;True, you sent your&#xA;fourteen warriors with me. But the&#xA;fourteen now lie stiff and cold in death,&#xA;slain by Rama, whose skill with weapons&#xA;baffles description. If you have a spark of&#xA;pride in you, start at once, fight with&#xA;Rama and save the Rakshasa race. If you&#xA;do not, the destruction of our people is&#xA;certain. But if you are afraid, tell me so&#xA;and I shall understand. These young men&#xA;who have entered your satrapy are&#xA;determined to destroy your race, unless&#xA;you first meet and destroy them.&amp;ldquo;These words, spoken by his sister in a&#xA;loud voice before all his courtiers, pierced&#xA;Khara&amp;rsquo;s heart.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why do you speak thus terrified by a&#xA;puny human being? Hold yourself in&#xA;patience for a moment and you will have&#xA;his blood to drink.&amp;rdquo; So saying, Khara rose.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not go alone!&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Take&#xA;your army with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Khara gave orders accordingly. A great&#xA;army, fully armed, went in advance under&#xA;the leadership of Dushana. Behind the&#xA;army Khara proceeded majestically in a&#xA;chariot. On the way he met with many bad&#xA;omens which affected the spirits of his&#xA;host. He laughed and reassured his army,&#xA;saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Never have I been so far defeated in&#xA;battle. Do not mind these portents. We&#xA;shall soon crush these two little men and&#xA;return in triumph.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The army took heart at these bold&#xA;words of their leader.&#xA;Hearing the tumultuous noise of the&#xA;approaching army, Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;prepared&#xA;for&#xA;battle.&#xA;Rama&#xA;told&#xA;Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;Do you see the signs? It is&#xA;certain that the Rakshasas of Janasthana&#xA;are coming here to their death! I see in&#xA;your face the glory of the victory that&#xA;awaits us. Arm yourself and take Sita with&#xA;you to a cave in the hill and look after her.&#xA;I shall encounter the Rakshasa hordes and&#xA;destroy them. Go at once. I do not require&#xA;any help.&amp;rdquo; Saying this, Rama put on his&#xA;armor and strung his bow.&#xA;Lakshmana did as Rama bade and took&#xA;Sita to a mountain cave.&#xA;A great battle was to follow. So the&#xA;Devas and Gandharvas hovered in the&#xA;heavens to watch the fight. They uttered&#xA;benedictions and prayed for Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;victory. The rishis had misgivings. How&#xA;was Rama, standing single, to meet and&#xA;quell this huge army? As Rama stood&#xA;there, bow in hand, the radiance of his&#xA;face was like that of Rudra himself when&#xA;he bent his great bow Pinaka.&#xA;The Rakshasa force advanced in proud&#xA;array, with drums and trumpets and the&#xA;clanking pageantry of war filling the&#xA;quarters with clamor and causing the&#xA;denizens of the forest to stampede in all&#xA;directions. Rama stood holding his bow&#xA;with his band on the string. Like great&#xA;black clouds disturbing the sun the&#xA;Rakshasa hordes surrounded him.&#xA;The battle began. But while even the&#xA;Devas wondered how he could withstand&#xA;the yelling masses which rushed on him, a&#xA;constant stream of deadly arrows sped&#xA;from his bow before which the Rakshasa&#xA;ranks withered and fell like moths before&#xA;a blazing fire.&#xA;Dushana himself now stood in front of&#xA;Rama. Rama bent his bow and sent his&#xA;shafts in all directions in an unceasing&#xA;stream. Like rays from the sun, and with&#xA;the speed of light, arrows shot out from&#xA;the spot where Rama stood, spread out in&#xA;all directions and brought down warriors,&#xA;chariots, elephants and horses.&#xA;The shafts pierced the bodies of the&#xA;Rakshasas and came out, covered with&#xA;their blood shining like fire. The army&#xA;was utterly destroyed and Rama stood&#xA;still, like Siva at the end of Time.&#xA;Dushana came again with another great&#xA;army. For a while he seemed indomitable.&#xA;But soon Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrows laid low his&#xA;chariot, drivers and horses. He jumped&#xA;down and sprang towards Rama. Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrows, however, severed his arms from&#xA;his trunk. And the monster fell dead on&#xA;the ground like a huge elephant. Other&#xA;Rakshasas, who saw Dushana falling,&#xA;rushed against Rama and were also slain&#xA;by the arrows that sped from his Kodanda&#xA;bow.&#xA;In this way, the whole army of Khara&#xA;was destroyed. It had come roaring like an&#xA;ocean and now it lay still, a mass ofcorpses and severed limbs and derelict&#xA;weapons and broken chariots.&#xA;Only Khara and Trisiras remained. As&#xA;Khara rushed forward to meet Rama,&#xA;Trisiras stopped him saying: &amp;ldquo;I shall go&#xA;first and kill Rama. Or else, I shall be&#xA;killed. After I am dead, you may meet&#xA;him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The three-headed Rakshasa mounted&#xA;on his chariot attacked Rama with his&#xA;arrows. Rama met them with arrows that&#xA;hissed like deadly serpents. At last&#xA;Trisiras collapsed and fell spitting blood.&#xA;His followers fled like deer.&#xA;Khara, seeing this, cried: &amp;lsquo;Hold&amp;rsquo; to the&#xA;fugitives and directed his chariot against&#xA;Rama. His confident pride was gone but&#xA;he fought manfully. The shafts sent by the&#xA;two warriors covered the sky. Khara stood&#xA;like Yama in his chariot, sending his&#xA;stream of arrows. For an instant, Rama&#xA;leaned on his bow. In that interval Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;armor was pierced by Khara&amp;rsquo;s arrows and&#xA;showed the prince&amp;rsquo;s body shining like the&#xA;sun.&#xA;Rama now took up the bow of Vishnu&#xA;and laid low Khara&amp;rsquo;s chariot and cut his&#xA;bow in twain. Khara then took his mace&#xA;and approached Rama. The Devas and&#xA;rishis watching the battle became anxious&#xA;and renewed their benedictions.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have been a terror and a plague&#xA;to mankind!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Rama. &amp;ldquo;Strength&#xA;of body is no protection to an evil-doer.&#xA;You have persecuted and killed rishis&#xA;engaged in penance in the forest. You will&#xA;now receive the punishment due for these&#xA;sins of yours. The spirits of the rishis&#xA;whose flesh you fed on are now&#xA;witnessing your punishment from their&#xA;aerial chariots. I have come to the&#xA;Dandaka forest to destroy wicked&#xA;Rakshasas. My arrows will pierce the&#xA;bodies of all your kinsfolk. Your head will&#xA;soon roll on the ground like a ripe fruit.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Human worm!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Khara.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Dasaratha! Have done with&#xA;boasting! You are proud because you have&#xA;killed a few common Rakshasas. A hero&#xA;boasts not as you do. Only a Kshatriya&#xA;banished by his people can talk boasting&#xA;like this. You have shown you can brag.&#xA;Let us see now if you can fight! Your&#xA;words have blazed up like burning straw&#xA;with little heat or life. Here I stand mace&#xA;in hand, like Yama to take your life.&#xA;Evening approaches. Be prepared to lose&#xA;your life. I am here to avenge the death of&#xA;these my followers whom you have&#xA;killed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying, he whirled his mace, and&#xA;hurled it at Rama. The mace was split by&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrows into splinters which fell&#xA;harmless on the ground. &amp;ldquo;Have you&#xA;finished speaking, Rakshasa? Now you&#xA;shall die. This forest will be safe hereafter&#xA;and the rishis will live in peace,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Rama.&#xA;Even while Rama was speaking, Khara&#xA;pulled out by its roots a huge tree, and&#xA;gnashing his teeth, threw it at Rama. But&#xA;this too Rama split by his arrows. And&#xA;fearing further delay, he aimed deadly&#xA;darts at Khara. The wounded Rakshasa&#xA;sprang on Rama intending close combat&#xA;with him. But the latter avoided contact&#xA;by stepping back and laid him dead with a&#xA;shaft which clove his breast.&#xA;The Devas showered flowers from on&#xA;high and cried in joy: &amp;ldquo;Rama has killed&#xA;the sinful Rakshasa. Men can live in peace&#xA;in the Dandaka forest hereafter. Within an&#xA;hour Rama has destroyed Khara, Dushana,&#xA;Trisiras and their whole army. Indeed he&#xA;is a hero.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita and Lakshmana returned from the&#xA;cave. Lakshmana embraced Rama and&#xA;rejoiced that single-handed he had&#xA;fulfilled the promise of safety he had&#xA;given to the rishis.How did Rama all alone perform these&#xA;feats? If one observes a cow guarding her&#xA;calf and scattering a whole crowd of men,&#xA;one can realise the power of love. Love is&#xA;a supreme quality which according to&#xA;occasion manifests itself in diverse heroic&#xA;forms such as valor and self-sacrifice, just&#xA;like gold which can be changed for silver&#xA;or goods or other things of value. When&#xA;God assumes human form and is engaged&#xA;in fulfilling His promise to save the&#xA;helpless, His limitless power comes into&#xA;play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AKAMPANA, one of the few&#xA;Rakshasas who survived the great&#xA;slaughter at Panchavati, fled to Lanka and&#xA;seeking audience of Ravana, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Almost all our people who occupied&#xA;Janasthana are dead and Janasthana is&#xA;now an empty ruin. I alone have managed&#xA;to escape with life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana was furious with anger. He&#xA;stared and violently shouted: &amp;ldquo;Who&#xA;destroyed my lovely Janasthana? Was it&#xA;Yama or Agni or Vishnu? I shall deal&#xA;death to the god of death. I shall burn up&#xA;both the god of fire and the sun. I shall&#xA;strangle and suffocate the god of wind.&#xA;Tell me, who was it that destroyed&#xA;Janasthana and killed my men heedless&#xA;that I am here to avenge? Speak out at&#xA;once.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was ever dangerous to carry&#xA;unpleasant news to tyrants. Akampana&#xA;was frightened by the king&amp;rsquo;s rage and said,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I shall speak, if you give me protection.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He then told his tale. &amp;ldquo;Rama, son of&#xA;Dasaratha, a young warrior, lion-like in&#xA;fierce valor, a hero who has already&#xA;acquired fame among men, fought with&#xA;Khara and Dushana at Panchavati and&#xA;destroyed them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasa king hissed like a cobra&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;What are you talking? How did&#xA;this happen? Did Indra and the divine&#xA;hosts come down to earth and fight on&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s side?&amp;rdquo; Akampana answered: &amp;ldquo;No&#xA;such thing happened, great king. Alone&#xA;did Rama stand against our whole army&#xA;and its commanders and destroyed them&#xA;all. And Khara and Dushana too were&#xA;slain. The deadly arrows issuing from&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s bow like five-headed serpents&#xA;pursued the Rakshasas wherever they&#xA;went and destroyed them.&amp;rdquo; And he went&#xA;on to describe at length Rama&amp;rsquo;s skill and&#xA;speed in the use of his weapons.&#xA;And so Ravana learnt that Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;son, Rama, with his younger brother&#xA;Lakshmana was at Panchavati and that he,&#xA;alone without even his brother&amp;rsquo;s aid, had&#xA;done it all and that no gods had come to&#xA;their aid.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; said Ravana, &amp;ldquo;I do not&#xA;understand this but I shall start at once. I&#xA;shall destroy these little worms of men&#xA;and return.&amp;rdquo; And he rose. &amp;ldquo;Hear me, great&#xA;king, before you go,&amp;rdquo; said Akampana, and&#xA;explained once again Rama&amp;rsquo;s strength and&#xA;courage.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Listen to me. No one can fight with&#xA;Rama and conquer him. When I say &amp;lsquo;No&#xA;one,&amp;rsquo; I mean &amp;lsquo;No one.&amp;rsquo; Not even you can&#xA;do it. Because you have promised me&#xA;protection, I dare thus to tell you the plain&#xA;truth. There is only one way of killing&#xA;him. His wife is with him. The whole&#xA;earth holds not her equal in beauty. If you&#xA;contrive to carry her off, separation from&#xA;her will kill Rama; so great is his love for&#xA;her. Consider how you can do this. Do not&#xA;think of battle with him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When he heard of Sita&amp;rsquo;s beauty, the&#xA;Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s desire was kindled. He began&#xA;to think that the defeat of Khara and his&#xA;hosts was indeed a fortunate event that&#xA;brought him an opportunity for gaining&#xA;one more beautiful queen and wife. He&#xA;welcomed Akampana&amp;rsquo;s advice and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Tomorrow morning I shall go. I think&#xA;your plan is good.&amp;ldquo;Accordingly Ravana set out in his&#xA;mule-yoked flying chariot which gleamed&#xA;like the moon among the clouds as it sped&#xA;fast in the air. He went straight to&#xA;Maricha&amp;rsquo;s dwelling.&#xA;Maricha duly welcomed his king and&#xA;inquired what urgent necessity brought&#xA;him there. Ravana answered: &amp;ldquo;Hear me,&#xA;Maricha. You and you alone can help me.&#xA;Janasthana has been destroyed and so too&#xA;the whole army I had stationed there. All&#xA;this is the work of Rama, son of&#xA;Dasaratha. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it amazing? To avenge&#xA;myself, I am resolved to carry off his&#xA;wife. In this I need your advice and help.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Maricha ,whose experience of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;prowess had seared into his soul, was&#xA;horrified and tried to dissuade Ravana&#xA;from his mad enterprise.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What plan is this? Some enemy&#xA;determined to destroy you, but pretending&#xA;to be your friend, has given you this plan&#xA;of carrying off Sita. Whoever gave you&#xA;this advice wishes the end of the Rakshasa&#xA;race. It is like advising you to put your&#xA;hand into the mouth of a sleeping cobra&#xA;and pull out its fang. Haven&amp;rsquo;t you a happy&#xA;home and devoted wives? Return to them,&#xA;and enjoy your life and prosperity. To&#xA;hanker after Rama&amp;rsquo;s wife is the highway to&#xA;disgrace and destruction and the&#xA;annihilation of the Rakshasa race.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ten-headed Ravana went back to&#xA;Lanka, for Maricha&amp;rsquo;s counsel appeared&#xA;right to him. Ravana must have then&#xA;remembered the omission in the series of&#xA;boons he had secured. He had obtained&#xA;immunity from the attacks of all beings&#xA;except men. Rama&amp;rsquo;s shafts had conquered&#xA;and killed the whole army with Khara,&#xA;Trisiras, Dushana and other mighty&#xA;warriors. Thinking of all this, Ravana&#xA;accepted Maricha&amp;rsquo;s advice.&#xA;But fate would not let him be. Ravana&#xA;was seated on his throne with his&#xA;counsellors around him. Majesty shone on&#xA;his face like a sacrificial flame fed with&#xA;ghee and his mighty body showed the&#xA;scars of many wounds received in&#xA;victorious battle against gods, asuras and&#xA;others.&#xA;His strength and courage were&#xA;limitless, so was his adharma. He had no&#xA;equal in persecuting Devas, spoiling&#xA;sacrifices and carrying away women. The&#xA;hosts of Devas and asuras were mortally&#xA;afraid of him. He was a terror to all&#xA;creatures. Enjoying wealth and varied&#xA;pleasures, freed from the fear of death, the&#xA;ruler of Lanka knew no master or rival&#xA;and feared neither God nor sin.&#xA;With his ten heads, large eyes and huge&#xA;limbs, his figure was terrible, but it also&#xA;possessed&#xA;the&#xA;marks&#xA;of&#xA;royalty.&#xA;Gorgeously dressed and bejeweled as he&#xA;sat on his throne, surrounded by his&#xA;ministers in the midst of the splendor of&#xA;the despoiled world, there suddenly&#xA;appeared before him like the vision of the&#xA;doom to be, his sister Surpanakha,&#xA;bleeding and mutilated, a shape of pain&#xA;and sorrow and shame. While all looked&#xA;at her with horror struck eyes in stunned&#xA;silence, her anguish broke out in burning&#xA;words.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What a fool are you that, sunk in&#xA;sensual pleasures and arrogantly secure of&#xA;sovereignty.You are not awake to the&#xA;deadly danger that threatens your&#xA;existence at your very doors! Surely that&#xA;king who is drunk with self-importance&#xA;and dead to all portents that threaten his&#xA;state is doomed to shame and destruction!&#xA;No object is of less account or more&#xA;contemptible than a ruler who falls&#xA;through his own remissness. Know you&#xA;not that your brothers, Khara, Dushana&#xA;and Trisiras and your gallant army of&#xA;fourteen thousand fierce Rakshasas have&#xA;been exterminated by Rama, a mere man,&#xA;and that your outpost at Janasthana has&#xA;been destroyed? One moment I saw asingle warrior stand proud in the glittering&#xA;pageantry of war and the next, they lay&#xA;dead slain by that man&amp;rsquo;s arrows, strewing&#xA;the ground like ripe crops devastated by a&#xA;terrible hail-storm. And you see me, your&#xA;own sister, disgraced, mutilated and heart-&#xA;broken! Have you no thoughts of&#xA;vengeance, you, a hero, a brother, king?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Stung by her contempt and heart-struck&#xA;by her suffering and sorrow, Ravana said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Be sure you shall have vengeance. But&#xA;this Rama, who is he? What sort of man is&#xA;he? What are his weapons? How does he&#xA;fight? What seeks he in Dandaka forest?&#xA;And how happened it that you were so&#xA;cruelly mutilated?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She gave a description of the brothers&#xA;and Sita, dwelling on the virile beauty and&#xA;powers of the brothers, probably with a&#xA;view to provoke the envious jealousy of&#xA;the&#xA;Rakshasa.&#xA;And&#xA;growing&#xA;enthusiastically&#xA;eloquent&#xA;about&#xA;the&#xA;superlative loveliness of Sita, she said: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;have no words to describe her perfections.&#xA;I have never seen such sublime beauty in&#xA;any created thing, be it Gandharva or&#xA;Kinnara or a daughter of man. And now, I&#xA;will tell you why this ghastly outrage was&#xA;perpetrated on me. On seeing this Sita, I&#xA;felt that none but you deserved her and&#xA;that she was fully worthy to share your&#xA;bed and out of my love for you I tried to&#xA;carry her off for you. Lakshmana, who&#xA;was standing by, prevented it and,&#xA;springing on me, disfigured and disgraced&#xA;me thus. For your sake, all this I have&#xA;suffered. If you wish to avenge this insult&#xA;and protect the honor of the race, rise and&#xA;go at once. Apart from revenge for the&#xA;insult I have suffered, secure for yourself&#xA;a wife worthy of you. If you capture her&#xA;and disgrace Rama, the spirits of the&#xA;warriors who were slain in Dandaka&#xA;would be satisfied. I too shall feel that&#xA;some amends have been made for the&#xA;dishonor done to me. You do not know&#xA;your own strength. You can easily secure&#xA;Sita, and make her your own. And can&#xA;you remain indifferent to the insult to your&#xA;race? Khara and Dushana lie dead in&#xA;Janasthana because they dared oppose&#xA;Rama. Think of all this and do what is&#xA;right. Save, oh, save, the honor of our&#xA;race.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to these words of his sister&#xA;and her praise of Sita&amp;rsquo;s beauty, Ravana&#xA;dissolved the council and retired to muse&#xA;alone. He had to think and think again,&#xA;because he remembered what Maricha had&#xA;told him. He turned in his mind the pros&#xA;and cons and finally coming to a decision&#xA;ordered a chariot to be kept ready in&#xA;secrecy.&#xA;It was ready, his golden chariot, drawn&#xA;by mules bearing demon faces. Mounting&#xA;it, he passed over sea and land and cities.&#xA;As he looked from his magic chariot at the&#xA;sights of the summer season down below,&#xA;his passion grew stronger.&#xA;He reached Maricha&amp;rsquo;s ashrama and met&#xA;Maricha who, with matted hair and bark&#xA;garments, lived the life of an ascetic.&#xA;Seeing his king and kinsman, Maricha&#xA;welcomed Ravana duly and said: &amp;ldquo;Why&#xA;have you come all this way a second time&#xA;and unannounced?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana, skillful in speech began: &amp;ldquo;I am&#xA;in great trouble from which only you can&#xA;save me. I beg you for help. Do you know&#xA;how my brothers, under my orders, ruled&#xA;Janasthana and how they and their&#xA;warriors knew no opposition all these&#xA;years? But now this man Rama has killed&#xA;them and their whole army. Without a&#xA;chariot, and standing on the ground, his&#xA;arrows have pierced to death all our&#xA;kinsmen. Today, in the Dandaka forest,&#xA;rid of Rakshasas, the rishis live fearless&#xA;lives. This Rama is a worthless prince&#xA;banished by his father, no doubt for some&#xA;crime. He has been wandering in the&#xA;forest alone with his wife, Sita. Thisfellow dressed like an ascetic but enjoying&#xA;sense-pleasures, this renegade from&#xA;dharma, proud of his strength and for no&#xA;other reason, has mutilated the face of my&#xA;sister and insulted our race. My sister who&#xA;has suffered this pain and shame had&#xA;come and complained to me. If, with all&#xA;this, I sit still and do nothing, would I still&#xA;be a king? To avenge myself I have&#xA;decided to carry off Rama&amp;rsquo;s wife from the&#xA;Dandaka forest. To disgrace and punish&#xA;this Rama is a duty I owe to my race. And&#xA;for this I need your help. With you to help&#xA;me, I have no fear. In courage, strength,&#xA;skill and magic powers, none on earth can&#xA;equal you. That is why I have come to&#xA;you. You cannot refuse me. I will tell you&#xA;how you can help me. You should turn&#xA;yourself into a golden deer, a golden deer&#xA;with silver spots, casting a spell on all&#xA;eyes. In that shape romp in front of Sita&#xA;near Rama&amp;rsquo;s ashrama. True to the&#xA;character of women, she will insist on&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana pursuing and&#xA;capturing you for her. When they are thus&#xA;engaged and she is left alone, I shall easily&#xA;carry her off. Sita is a most beautiful&#xA;woman. Rama losing such a wife is sure&#xA;to languish in sorrow and lose his manly&#xA;spirit. It will then be easy to kill him and&#xA;avenge ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Maricha stared at Ravana. His face&#xA;became pale and his mouth grew parched.&#xA;He was frightened by Ravana&amp;rsquo;s plan. With&#xA;his experience of Rama&amp;rsquo;s prowess and his&#xA;own wisdom born of penance, Maricha&#xA;saw what was going to happen.&#xA;He knew that Ravana&amp;rsquo;s sinful purpose&#xA;had not the ghost of a chance of success.&#xA;It was clear to him that the noose of fate&#xA;was round Ravana&amp;rsquo;s neck dragging him to&#xA;inevitable ruin. He had spoken no doubt&#xA;of the honor of the Rakshasas, of the&#xA;duties of kingship and of the insult to&#xA;Surpanakha. But he was really impelled&#xA;by a lustful desire to possess Sita. All this&#xA;Maricha saw.&#xA;We should analyse Surpanakha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;motives too. She had suffered because of&#xA;her own uncontrollable carnal desire.&#xA;Though it was Lakshmana who mutilated&#xA;her she was not so angry with him as with&#xA;Sita who stood between her and her desire&#xA;and whose beauty and virtue she hated as&#xA;darkness hates light.&#xA;The one desire that now burned in her&#xA;heart was to avenge herself by bringing&#xA;disgrace on Sita. In order to use Ravana&#xA;for this purpose, she described Sita in&#xA;such glowing terms to him and kindled his&#xA;lawless passion. The rest of her talk was&#xA;ancillary to her main purpose. Reference&#xA;to the honor of the race, the security of his&#xA;empire, the slaying of his kinsmen and so&#xA;on was only to serve her main purpose&#xA;which was to rouse Ravana&amp;rsquo;s lust and&#xA;make him desire Sita and he was caught in&#xA;the snare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MARICHA told Ravana, &amp;ldquo;I have&#xA;listened, my king, to all that you have said&#xA;and I am filled with boundless sorrow. It&#xA;is easy to flatter. Flattery is ever pleasant&#xA;to the ears. Those who utter good though&#xA;unpalatable advice are few; and fewer still&#xA;are those who welcome it when given. Yet&#xA;it is my duty to speak to you the harsh&#xA;truth. Sweet words might please you now,&#xA;but will surely lead you to danger and&#xA;ruin. Your informants have not told you&#xA;the truth about Rama. Do not be deceived&#xA;by what you have heard from others about&#xA;this Rama. He is neither a renegade nor a&#xA;criminal, but a dutiful son who is in the&#xA;forest to honor his father&amp;rsquo;s word. Far from&#xA;being a weakling or coward, he is a&#xA;mighty warrior, whose equal in arms does&#xA;not exist. Do not make him your&#xA;implacable enemy and bring ruin on your&#xA;people and your kingdom. From what you&#xA;are bent upon, it looks as though Sita wasborn only to compass your ruin. The race&#xA;of Rakshasas and Lanka itself will soon be&#xA;destroyed on your account. Who is the&#xA;enemy that has put this disastrous thought&#xA;into your head? Who has given you this&#xA;bad advice to take you, your kingdom and&#xA;your race to danger and destruction? Who&#xA;told you that he was a lover of pleasure&#xA;and falsehood? Rama is the embodiment&#xA;of dharma. He employs his strength and&#xA;courage in the service of dharma. As Indra&#xA;is surely the first among the gods, Rama is&#xA;first among mortal men. How dare you,&#xA;how could you, cast longing eyes on Sita?&#xA;Will Sita ever yield to you? Take her from&#xA;Rama indeed! Can one deceive the sun&#xA;and steal from him his light? You will be&#xA;reduced to ashes if you approach the&#xA;blazing fire of Janaka&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Do not&#xA;fall a prey to Rama&amp;rsquo;s shafts. Do not seek&#xA;your own death. Do not approach the fire&#xA;guarded by Rama. One should not launch&#xA;on a course of action without full thought.&#xA;You can never vanquish Rama in battle.&#xA;O, Ruler of the Rakshasas, do not turn a&#xA;deaf ear to my words. Do you remember&#xA;how, in olden days, proud of my strength,&#xA;I disturbed the rites and sacrifice of the&#xA;sage Viswamitra. In those days Rama was&#xA;but a boy; yet Viswamitra had, with&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s permission, taken young&#xA;Rama to protect his sacrifice. That sage&#xA;knew Rama&amp;rsquo;s prowess. I approached the&#xA;place to put out the sacrificial fire with&#xA;contaminating blood and flesh and then I&#xA;came up against the boy Rama. What do&#xA;you think happened? He let loose an&#xA;arrow which killed Subahu on the spot&#xA;and with another he swept me off my feet&#xA;and hurled me into the sea. Rama the boy&#xA;is now a man, immeasurably stronger and&#xA;more skillful in arms! Do not incur his&#xA;wrath. Do not bring ruin on your people&#xA;who are now enjoying wealth and&#xA;pleasure. Do not harbor thoughts about&#xA;Sita and bring down destruction on your&#xA;rich and beautiful city and certain death&#xA;on yourself. If your persist in your foolish&#xA;project, O Ravana, I see before my eyes&#xA;the ruin that awaits you. I see Lanka in&#xA;flames and her streets littered with death,&#xA;and her widows and orphans loud in&#xA;lamentation. Avoid this great sin. If you&#xA;are angry with Rama fight him face to&#xA;face and meet your death like a hero. Do&#xA;not follow a fraudulent path and drag me&#xA;into it. Go back and be happy with your&#xA;numerous wives. Do not invite Yama to&#xA;your land and race!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Maricha earnestly pleaded for the&#xA;good of Ravana who, however, was far&#xA;from pleased or convinced. How could&#xA;good advice prevail on a victim of lust?&#xA;Like a sick man rejecting medicine,&#xA;Ravana refused to listen to Maricha&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;counsel.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If a king&amp;rdquo; said Ravana, &amp;ldquo;wants to&#xA;know whether a thing should or should&#xA;not be done, it is open to his adviser to&#xA;examine its advantages and disadvantages,&#xA;but I have not come to you for such&#xA;advice. I am king and I have come to tell&#xA;you that I have decided to do this. I expect&#xA;and want your help to carry it out. You&#xA;forget the loyalty due from you and dare&#xA;tell me that what I contemplate is wrong.&#xA;On this matter, I have considered&#xA;everything and reached a decision. This&#xA;insignificant creature whom you extol is&#xA;unworthy of the honor of a formal&#xA;challenge to battle from me. What more is&#xA;he than a man driven out of his own&#xA;country, a fool who has allowed himself&#xA;to be cheated by a woman and has been&#xA;deprived of his rights? The proper&#xA;treatment or such a fellow is to disgrace&#xA;him by carrying off his wife. This is a&#xA;matter determined and concluded. Your&#xA;remarks are therefore irrelevant. You&#xA;should do what I want you to do and that&#xA;is not much. Transform yourself into a&#xA;strange and beautiful stag and appearbefore Sita and attract her attention. Sita&#xA;will send Rama to pursue and capture you.&#xA;You should draw Rama away to a distance&#xA;and simulate Rama&amp;rsquo;s voice and cry &amp;lsquo;Ah,&#xA;Sita, Ah, Lakshmana!&amp;rsquo; Hearing this Sita&#xA;will conclude that Rama is in danger and&#xA;she will force Lakshmana to go to his&#xA;help. When thus she is alone, I shall carry&#xA;her off to Lanka. Once you have rendered&#xA;me this help, you will be at liberty to do&#xA;what you like. But if you will not help me&#xA;now, understand, your life shall be&#xA;forfeit.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Maricha thought within himself. &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;frenzied Ravana who is already under the&#xA;shadow of doom will not listen to advice.&#xA;Sinful desire is driving him to Yama. It is&#xA;better for me to be killed by Rama than by&#xA;Ravana. At least then I would yield my&#xA;life to a foe.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so be agreed to the proposal.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;I have given you good&#xA;advice, but you will not listen. If I carry&#xA;out your wishes, I am sure to die. But not&#xA;more sure than that you will also perish,&#xA;not long after with all that is yours. So&#xA;will our race. Some enemy of ours&#xA;wishing our destruction has set you on this&#xA;course, someone who envies you. I would&#xA;rather be killed by a foe whom I respect&#xA;than by you. Come, let us go to Dandaka.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana was overjoyed and embraced&#xA;Maricha saying: &amp;ldquo;Now you are again my&#xA;dear old Maricha.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The two ascended the chariot and&#xA;proceeded towards the Dandaka forest.&#xA;They flew over cities, mountains, rivers&#xA;and kingdoms. Reaching Dandaka, they&#xA;espied Rama&amp;rsquo;s ashrama in a banana&#xA;garden.&#xA;They alighted at a distance and Ravana&#xA;took Maricha by the hand and, pointing to&#xA;the ashrama, told him to do his part&#xA;according to their plan.&#xA;At once Maricha transformed himself&#xA;into a wonderful deer. Every part of the&#xA;animal had its own different hue and&#xA;exquisite beauty. Like a rainbow in the&#xA;sky, it charmed the eye of the beholder.&#xA;Gold, silver, diamonds, gems and flowers&#xA;seemed to appear in succession on its&#xA;beautiful skin. It was like a living stream&#xA;of jewels flowing on a beautiful golden&#xA;body.&#xA;With such surpassing beauty the magic&#xA;deer wandered here and there, now resting&#xA;for a while and now pursuing its graceful&#xA;gambols. It would sometimes bend and&#xA;nibble the grass on the ground, again lift&#xA;its head up to eat the tender leaves of&#xA;plants. Sometimes walk slowly near the&#xA;ashrama and again jump away and&#xA;disappear and reappear at a distance.&#xA;Sometimes it would join a herd of deer;&#xA;then it would part from it and walk alone.&#xA;The other deer would smell him and move&#xA;away in sudden terror.&#xA;Sita, who was then gathering flowers in&#xA;the forest, looked at the stag and stared&#xA;spell-bound at its wondrous beauty. The&#xA;deer, too, stared back at her and ran here&#xA;and there in front of her, shedding a new&#xA;beauty on the landscape.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do come and look! Do come and&#xA;look!&amp;rdquo; cried Sita, eager that Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana too should see that wonderful&#xA;stag.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Come quickly, quickly!&amp;rdquo; she cried.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana came out of the&#xA;cottage and saw the exquisite creature and&#xA;marvelled at its beauty.&#xA;Lakshmana grew suspicious. It seemed&#xA;to him it was no ordinary deer, but a&#xA;Rakshasa in disguise. Both Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana had heard about Maricha and&#xA;had been told how, assuming the form of a&#xA;deer, he would often beguile and destroy&#xA;those who came for hunting deer in the&#xA;forest.&#xA;Lakshmana said, &amp;ldquo;This is no ordinary&#xA;animal. This is a trick of the Rakshasas.&amp;ldquo;But Sita said: &amp;ldquo;Do catch this deer for&#xA;me. We shall bring it up as a pet in the&#xA;ashrama. This is the most beautiful&#xA;creature I have so far seen in this forest.&#xA;Look! Do look at it. What color! What&#xA;playfulness!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so she went on, talking of the deer&#xA;and desiring to possess it. And she&#xA;pleaded: &amp;ldquo;Do somehow catch it for me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She begged Rama: &amp;ldquo;Soon we shall&#xA;have to return to the city. Should we not&#xA;take some rare thing from the forest to&#xA;Ayodhya? How beautiful it will be, this&#xA;exquisite creature moving in the inner&#xA;apartments of our palace? Bharata would&#xA;be so pleased. I should love to give it to&#xA;him. Do my beloved, catch it for me.&#xA;Somehow catch it for me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita saw that Lakshmana did not seem&#xA;to like her importunity. This only made&#xA;her more determined to persuade Rama to&#xA;get it for her. If a strong desire creeps into&#xA;our heart and someone stands in the way&#xA;of it, we are angry with him no matter&#xA;how dear he may be to us.&#xA;This unfortunate truth about the way&#xA;that desire works in the human mind is&#xA;explained clearly by the Lord in the Gita.&#xA;It was demonstrated by what happened in&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s heart now.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look!&amp;rdquo; she exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;it is all gold!&#xA;Look now! It is all silver! If you cannot&#xA;capture the creature alive, at least bring it&#xA;down with an arrow and let us take the&#xA;skin home. We shall never again see such&#xA;a beautiful skin. It would be a lovely thing&#xA;to sit on. Look. It is going away. Do go&#xA;and catch it alive. Or else, let me have at&#xA;least the skin.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again she said, &amp;ldquo;Look, look again. All&#xA;these long years, I never saw such a&#xA;beautiful thing in these forests. It is like a&#xA;cluster of shining stars!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama could no longer resist her&#xA;entreaties.&#xA;He said to himself: &amp;ldquo;Even if&#xA;Lakshmana be right and the creature is a&#xA;Rakshasa so much the better reason for&#xA;killing it. What is there to be afraid of? If I&#xA;cannot catch it alive, I can bring it down&#xA;with an arrow and give the skin to Sita.&#xA;When she is so keen on having it, is it not&#xA;my duty to get it for her?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he told Lakshmana to bring him&#xA;his bow and arrows. Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s heart&#xA;was not in it, but he obeyed.&#xA;And Rama set out saying: &amp;ldquo;Mind,&#xA;Lakshmana, remain by Sita&amp;rsquo;s side and&#xA;guard her vigilantly. I shall come back&#xA;soon with this stag alive or killed. Do not&#xA;be anxious. Even if this is a Rakshasa,&#xA;what does it matter? It will share the fate&#xA;of Vatapi. If this has come here to cheat&#xA;me, as Vatapi tried to cheat Agastya, why&#xA;then, it will be the victim of its own&#xA;deceit. What can this animal do to me?&#xA;Stag or Rakshasa, it is all the same.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again he said, &amp;ldquo;Be careful. Mind Sita.&#xA;Anything might happen at any time. Be&#xA;vigilant.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Destiny had set the stage for&#xA;misfortune. Strangely enough Lakshmana,&#xA;who was by nature hasty and quick to act,&#xA;was suspicious on this occasion and&#xA;Rama, who was usually circumspect now&#xA;yielded to Sita&amp;rsquo;s foolish wish, and&#xA;disregarding Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s warning, went&#xA;in pursuit of the Maricha-stag.&#xA;In order to give Ravana plenty of time&#xA;and opportunity, Maricha kept within&#xA;sight of Rama, but beyond his reach, and&#xA;drew him on and on like fate. The deer&#xA;would take a few steps, then stop and turn&#xA;and stare at the pursuer. Then suddenly it&#xA;would start as if in fear. Pricking its ears,&#xA;it would spring drawing up its hooves to&#xA;its breast. It would disappear for a while&#xA;among the trees. Emerging soon on some&#xA;tall mound, it would display its lovely&#xA;outline framed against a passing cloud.&#xA;Sometimes it allowed near approach asthough tired and so easy of capture but&#xA;presently it would spring up and bound far&#xA;away.&#xA;This went on until Maricha took Rama&#xA;far out. Then the Rakshasa realised this&#xA;game would not go on forever and that his&#xA;end was near. Rama, tired of the pursuit,&#xA;bent his bow and sent forth an arrow. It&#xA;pierced the stag. Maricha resumed his&#xA;natural form and simulating Rama&amp;rsquo;s voice&#xA;called out, &amp;ldquo;Ah Sita, Ah Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo; and&#xA;fell dead.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana was right,&amp;rdquo; said Rama to&#xA;himself. &amp;ldquo;This deer was indeed a&#xA;Rakshasa.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He thought further: &amp;ldquo;Hearing his last&#xA;cry, maybe, Sita will be deceived. She is&#xA;likely to be overwhelmed by fear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He then said to himself again: &amp;ldquo;What if&#xA;Sita entertains false fears? Lakshmana is&#xA;there by her side.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;His heart then swelled with pride and&#xA;joy, that he had a brother like Lakshmana,&#xA;so loving and so steadfast. How could&#xA;Rama guess what was happening at that&#xA;very instant in the ashrama, and what&#xA;painful words Lakshmana had to bear&#xA;from Sita? Truly, the way of destiny is&#xA;cruel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;ALAS,&#xA;alas!&#xA;Ah&#xA;Sita!&#xA;Ah&#xA;Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo; So cried Maricha simulating&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s voice. And Sita was deceived.&#xA;Trembling like a plantain tree in a storm,&#xA;she cried: &amp;ldquo;There, Lakshmana, do you not&#xA;hear your brother&amp;rsquo;s voice? Run, run at&#xA;once to his help!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Overwhelmed by fear and seeing&#xA;Lakshmana unwilling to move, she&#xA;appealed to Lakshmana again and again in&#xA;an agony of anxiety: &amp;ldquo;I hear my Lord&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;voice in distress. Go, go at once! Do not&#xA;delay!&amp;rdquo; she cried. &amp;ldquo;He is in some great&#xA;danger. Did you not hear his cry for help?&#xA;Why do you still stand here? Your brother&#xA;is no doubt surrounded by Rakshasas and&#xA;cries for help. Instead of rushing to his&#xA;rescue, you stand still here!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana knew the wiles of the&#xA;Rakshasas and remembered his brother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;command. He would not move.&#xA;Sita grew furious in her agony of fear&#xA;and doubt. She beat her breast with both&#xA;hands and shouted in uncontrollable fury:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Son of Sumitra! Have you too turned&#xA;foe? Have you been an imposter all these&#xA;years? Have you been with us waiting&#xA;only for Rama to die? Pretending to be his&#xA;friend, were you hoping all the time for&#xA;his death to secure me thereafter? Why&#xA;else do you stand here, wicked wretch,&#xA;and refuse to go to his rescue when he&#xA;cries for help? Traitor! Imposter!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These&#xA;cruel&#xA;words&#xA;pierced&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s heart like poisoned arrows.&#xA;He closed his ears with his hands. He&#xA;spoke gently to Sita, who was in tears of&#xA;wrath: &amp;ldquo;Vaidehi, Rama can encounter and&#xA;vanquish any foe in the world. There is no&#xA;need to fear, O more than mother! Calm&#xA;yourself. None in the universe is strong&#xA;enough to touch our Rama or do him&#xA;harm. What you have uttered is unworthy&#xA;of you, my mother. Do not fear or grieve.&#xA;You will surely see Rama return with the&#xA;body of the stag you wanted. The voice&#xA;we heard was not his. It is a Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;trick. Do not be deceived and grieve for&#xA;nothing. My brother has posted me here to&#xA;watch over you. Do not ask me to leave&#xA;you alone and go. I cannot disobey my&#xA;brother. Since we slew the Rakshasas of&#xA;Janasthana, their people are trying to&#xA;avenge themselves in various ways. We&#xA;should not be misled by their false forms&#xA;and voices. It was not Rama&amp;rsquo;s cry for help.&#xA;You need not be afraid in the least.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Sita&amp;rsquo;s fear grew to a frenzy and&#xA;with eyes red with anger she uttered&#xA;terrible words: &amp;ldquo;Taking advantage of what&#xA;you call your brother&amp;rsquo;s command, you&#xA;stand unmoved by his cry of anguish andare prepared to let him perish! Oh, how&#xA;completely have you been deceiving us,&#xA;Rama and me, all these years! Base,&#xA;wicked, selfish wretch calling yourself&#xA;brother! O, you false friend, do you&#xA;rejoice that Rama is in dire peril? I now&#xA;see why you followed us into the forest.&#xA;Have you been set on by Bharata? Have&#xA;you all become my lord&amp;rsquo;s enemies? Have&#xA;you all joined together in a wicked&#xA;conspiracy? I, who have lived with Rama,&#xA;shall I ever look at you or another? When&#xA;Rama dies, I die with him. Know this for&#xA;certain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita burst into a rage which completely&#xA;overwhelmed Lakshmana. Her cruel&#xA;words pierced and burnt into him like&#xA;poisoned arrows. His hairs stood on end.&#xA;He clasped his hands in worship and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Mother! O Goddess! How can such&#xA;words issue from your mouth? Like red-&#xA;hot iron they burn my ears. Cruel and&#xA;unjust are these thoughts of yours. With&#xA;all the gods for witness, I swear, your&#xA;suspicion is wrong. I see now that after all&#xA;you are a woman like other women quick&#xA;to think evil of others. I fear a great&#xA;tragedy is about to befall you. Otherwise&#xA;you could not have thought and spoken&#xA;evil of me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And innocent Lakshmana trembled in&#xA;fear of some dire calamity that was to&#xA;come over them.&#xA;But Sita said: &amp;ldquo;Look here, here is&#xA;plenty of dry fuel. I shall light a fire and&#xA;fall into it. Or I shall drown myself in the&#xA;Godavari. Or I shall hang myself dead,&#xA;unless you run immediately to the help of&#xA;Rama. Now, once again, I ask, will you&#xA;not go? Or shall I perish?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She beat her breast and cried.&#xA;Lakshmana could bear this no longer. He&#xA;raised his hands in solemn worship and&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Very well, sister. I shall obey you and&#xA;disobey my brother. I shall leave you&#xA;alone. May you be safe and well! May the&#xA;gods of the forest protect you! I shall do&#xA;your bidding. I see bad omens. I fear&#xA;greatly. I wonder if I shall ever see you&#xA;with Rama again. Yet I shall go!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he went, unwillingly and looking&#xA;back every now and then.&#xA;Lakshmana walked with his heart&#xA;troubled and heavy with anger and&#xA;sorrow. How could he bear to hear the&#xA;cruel words of Sita? How could he forget&#xA;them? Sorely wounded was the heart of&#xA;the prince who had renounced everything&#xA;to be with his brother.&#xA;Lakshmana went in the direction that&#xA;Rama had taken. Ravana, who had been&#xA;waiting for this, now approached Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;ashrama. He transformed himself into a&#xA;mendicant ascetic, clad in clean saffron&#xA;clothes and his lips uttered beautiful&#xA;Vedic hymns while in his heart was&#xA;ugliest evil.&#xA;Sita was standing at the entrance of the&#xA;cottage, her eyes fixed on the forest,&#xA;eagerly looking for Rama. Ravana beheld&#xA;Sita.&#xA;At sight of her, the desire planted in his&#xA;heart by Surpanakha took good root and&#xA;grew rapidly irresistible. He was more&#xA;determined than ever to possess Sita.&#xA;Seeing this wandering ascetic, clad in&#xA;saffron clothes, carrying his water-pot and&#xA;staff, Sita greeted him respectfully,&#xA;according to the courtesy due to holy men.&#xA;He desired hospitality. As in duty bound,&#xA;she offered him a seat and placed before&#xA;him some fruits and roots as was the&#xA;custom.&#xA;The ascetic sat and looked again at&#xA;Sita. His desire grew stronger. Sinner and&#xA;Rakshasa though he was, he had an&#xA;instinct that made him wish to win her&#xA;heart; he wished not to ravish but to&#xA;secure Sita&amp;rsquo;s willing consent and make her&#xA;his wife.The King of Lanka wanted and hoped&#xA;to persuade Sita. He thought she would&#xA;yield to him for his wealth and power,&#xA;turning her back on poverty-stricken&#xA;Rama. He thought also that this would be&#xA;the best way of disgracing and punishing&#xA;Rama. He expected Sita to behave like&#xA;other women he had known.&#xA;Seated in front of the fruits and roots&#xA;offered by Sita, the ascetic began to praise&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s beauty in terms too warm for a&#xA;genuine ascetic. He dwelt on the charms&#xA;of her person and asked: &amp;ldquo;Who are you?&#xA;Why are you here alone in the forest&#xA;haunted by Rakshasas and wild beasts?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She was astonished but answered his&#xA;questions. She hoped the prince would&#xA;return at once and kept her eyes fixed on&#xA;the doorway.&#xA;Little by little the visitor revealed who&#xA;he was and described the greatness of his&#xA;origin and family, his power and wealth.&#xA;After exalting himself, he proceeded to&#xA;run down Rama and concluded.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Be my wife and live a glorious life&#xA;with me in Lanka. Come, let us go!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In this unexpected situation, Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;purity gave her courage to defy the&#xA;powerful monster whom she now knew&#xA;for what he was.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Base and wicked fellow! Your&#xA;destruction is near. Leave this ashrama if&#xA;you would escape with life&amp;rdquo; she said,&#xA;hissing like an angry cobra.&#xA;The Rakshasa was furious. He&#xA;completely threw off all pretence of&#xA;disguise and gentleness and assumed his&#xA;real imperious wickedness. With one hand&#xA;he caught hold of her hair and with the&#xA;other lifted her up and carried her to the&#xA;chariot which waited for him behind the&#xA;trees. Forcing her into it, Ravana rose&#xA;with her into the air.&#xA;Sita cried aloud: &amp;ldquo;O my lord! Where&#xA;are you, my Rama? Oh Lakshmana, most&#xA;faithful of friends, why did I. with&#xA;obstinate folly, drive you away?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasa held her firmly down&#xA;and drove on in the aerial car. Sita&#xA;addressed the trees and plants down below&#xA;and begged them to tell Rama of her fate.&#xA;It happened that old Jatayu, half-asleep&#xA;upon a tree, saw the chariot flying past.&#xA;Startled by a woman&amp;rsquo;s cry of distress he&#xA;was wide awake in a moment and&#xA;recognised Sita by her voice. She also saw&#xA;him and appealed to him for rescue.&#xA;Jatayu&amp;rsquo;s blood was fired by the sight of&#xA;her piteous plight and he threw himself in&#xA;the way of the aerial car crying: &amp;ldquo;Hold,&#xA;hold! What is all this?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The King of Lanka is carrying me&#xA;away by force,&amp;rdquo; wailed Sita, &amp;ldquo;but what can&#xA;you do to prevent it, my poor old friend?&#xA;O fly to Rama and Lakshmana and tell&#xA;them my helpless plight!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Jatayu&amp;rsquo;s fighting blood, the blood&#xA;of generations of lordly ancestors who&#xA;ruled the air and knew not fear, was on&#xA;fire. He cared not for Ravana and his&#xA;might. He only saw a princess in distress.&#xA;He thought of his friend Dasaratha and his&#xA;promise to Rama and he was resolved that&#xA;this outrage should not occur while he&#xA;lived to prevent it.&#xA;Jatayu now addressed Ravana directly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh king, I am Jatayu, king of the eagles,&#xA;a king like you. Listen to me, brother&#xA;king! Forbear from this wicked act. How&#xA;can you call yourself a king and do this&#xA;shameful wrong? Is it not the rule of kings&#xA;to protect the honor of women? And Sita&#xA;is a princess. I warn you, you shall surely&#xA;perish unless you leave her and go. Her&#xA;very look will reduce you to ashes. You&#xA;are carrying a venomous cobra in your&#xA;bosom. The noose of Yama is round your&#xA;neck and dragging you to perdition. I am&#xA;old and unarmed and you are young, fully&#xA;armed and seated in a chariot. Yet I&#xA;cannot look on, while you carry off Sita.Why do you do this cowardly act behind&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s back? If you have any grievance&#xA;against him, meet him face to face. O, you&#xA;would fly away from me, would you? You&#xA;shall not escape while I am alive! I care&#xA;not for your chariot or your ten heads, or&#xA;your glittering arms! Your heads shall roll&#xA;on the ground that you have polluted with&#xA;your presence. Get down from your car,&#xA;and fight if you are not a coward as well&#xA;as a thief!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana flared up in a rage. He attacked&#xA;Jatayu. It was like a clash between a&#xA;mighty wind and a massive rain-cloud.&#xA;The battle raged in the sky above the&#xA;forest. Jatayu fought like a winged&#xA;mountain.&#xA;Ravana aimed deadly darts at him. But&#xA;the eagle intercepted them all and with his&#xA;talons tore Ravana&amp;rsquo;s flesh. The enraged&#xA;Rakshasa despatched sharp, serpent-like&#xA;missiles against the bird.&#xA;The&#xA;bird-hero&#xA;was&#xA;desparately&#xA;wounded, but fought on undauntedly&#xA;while Sita watched the unequal combat&#xA;with beating heart and tearful eyes. The&#xA;sight of her made Jatayu all the fiercer in&#xA;his attacks on Ravana. But his years were&#xA;telling on him and he felt he must gather&#xA;all his strength for a supreme attempt to&#xA;conquer. Regardless of the wounds, he&#xA;attacked Ravana fiercely and with his&#xA;wings broke off and threw down his&#xA;jewelled crown and deprived him of his&#xA;bow. He attacked the chariot and killed&#xA;the demon-faced mules and the charioteer&#xA;and smashed the vehicle into a thousand&#xA;pieces. Ravana fell on the ground, still&#xA;clutching Sita. The elements rejoiced to&#xA;see Ravana fall.&#xA;The gallant old bird swooped down on&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s back and tore great chunks of&#xA;flesh off it, and tried to wrench off the&#xA;arms which held Sita. But Ravana had&#xA;twenty arms, and no sooner was one&#xA;pulled off than another took its place and&#xA;Sita was held in writhing helplessness.&#xA;At last Ravana let go Sita and&#xA;unsheathing his sword cut off the bird&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wings and talons. The old bird was now&#xA;helpless and fell on the ground unable to&#xA;move.&#xA;Janaki ran and embraced Jatayu and&#xA;cried: &amp;ldquo;O my father! You have given away&#xA;your life for my sake. You are a second&#xA;father to my Lord! And now you are no&#xA;more. O our devoted brave friend!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Ravana turned towards her to&#xA;take her up again. Helplessly she ran&#xA;hither and thither, crying. She clung to the&#xA;trees and cried. &amp;ldquo;O my Rama, where are&#xA;you? O Lakshmana, where are you? Won&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;you, come to my rescue?&amp;rdquo; The Rakshasa&#xA;at last caught her and rose in the air.&#xA;As the dark and massive Ravana flew&#xA;in the sky with her, Sita struggling in his&#xA;grasp looked like a flash of lightning&#xA;across a great black cloud. The Rakshasa&#xA;carrying her appeared like a mountain&#xA;covered by a forest-fire. The body of&#xA;Ravana, lit up by Sita, coursed through the&#xA;sky like a calamitous comet.&#xA;Thus was Sita carried away by the&#xA;Rakshasa. The sun grew dim and untimely&#xA;darkness descended on the earth. All&#xA;beings lamented: &amp;ldquo;Dharma is destroyed.&#xA;Righteousness has disappeared. Virtue&#xA;and pity are no more.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The dumb creatures of the earth,&#xA;looking upwards, shed tears. Ravana,&#xA;cruelly clutching the princess, flew as&#xA;towards his ruin. As she was carried away,&#xA;the petals fell down from the flowers she&#xA;was wearing at that time and as they were&#xA;strewn along the path below, they seemed&#xA;to announce the scattering of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;fortune and affluence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SITA opened her eyes red with anger&#xA;and grief, and facing Ravana cried: &amp;ldquo;Base&#xA;fellow! You boasted of your fame andyour great origin and your warlike&#xA;qualities, but have you behaved like a&#xA;brave warrior? Are you not ashamed of&#xA;yourself? What sort of warrior is he who&#xA;waits for the husband&amp;rsquo;s absence to steal his&#xA;wife and carries off a lonely helpless&#xA;woman when no one is nearer to prevent&#xA;it? What heroic deed to kill the old bird&#xA;that tried to save me! How brave was your&#xA;talk in the ashrama! The world will no&#xA;doubt remember and praise this great hero&#xA;who dares not fight but is prepared to&#xA;steal! If indeed you come of a noble&#xA;family, what a shame you have brought&#xA;upon it! And what do you hope by thus&#xA;carrying me off? How long do you hope&#xA;to live? Very soon Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrows will&#xA;seek you out and end your life. Know that&#xA;the moment Rama sets eyes on you, you&#xA;are dead. Do not hope to escape. Your&#xA;death is certain at his hands. What then do&#xA;you gain by this cheating? I will never be&#xA;yours. I shall die before I yield to you and&#xA;you cannot escape my lord, having&#xA;incurred his wrath. Very soon you will see&#xA;the river Vaitarani in hell. The red-hot&#xA;image is awaiting you there for your&#xA;embrace. So is the tree with iron spikes.&#xA;Rama within an hour slew your army of&#xA;myriad Rakshasas in Janasthana. Will he&#xA;let you escape? Soon will he send you to&#xA;Yama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;While Sita was speaking words of&#xA;contempt&#xA;and&#xA;warning,&#xA;Ravana,&#xA;chariotless, sped like an arrow across the&#xA;sky towards Lanka. They went over many&#xA;mountains and rivers and Sita saw some&#xA;people below standing on a hilltop. She&#xA;took off her sash and tying up her jewels&#xA;in it threw the bundle down.&#xA;She did this hoping that the ornaments&#xA;thus dropped may be seen by Rama and&#xA;give him a clue of the direction in which&#xA;she was carried away.&#xA;Crossing the Pampa and then the sea,&#xA;Ravana entered the city of Lanka. He&#xA;went to his apartments with the grief-&#xA;stricken Sita. The fool thought that he had&#xA;secured the prize, but he was taking home&#xA;his own death in a woman&amp;rsquo;s form. Then,&#xA;summoning some demon-like Rakshasis,&#xA;he ordered them to keep watch over Sita,&#xA;specially commanding them to let none&#xA;approach her without his permission.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Give her whatever she wants, clothes&#xA;or gold or jewels. Serve her and do her&#xA;honor as you would serve and honor me,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he enjoined them.&#xA;And he added the warning: &amp;ldquo;Anyone&#xA;who utters a word which might offend her&#xA;will be punished with death. No one,&#xA;knowingly or unknowingly, should cause&#xA;her anger or grief.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having thus installed Sita in the inner&#xA;apartment, he considered what should be&#xA;done next. He sent for some clever spies&#xA;and gave them this mandate:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Go at once to Janasthana where Khara&#xA;lived. Watch carefully and bring me word&#xA;what Rama is doing. So long as that Rama&#xA;is alive I cannot sleep. He is my greatest&#xA;foe. Somehow, he should be killed. Go&#xA;boldly now and do your job and return.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Imprisoned within a fortress in a sea-&#xA;girt island, Sita did not know where she&#xA;was or how far from Rama. She expected&#xA;that her lord would somehow arrive, kill&#xA;Ravana and redeem her.&#xA;Though full of grief, thinking of the&#xA;strength and prowess of her lord she was&#xA;bold and steady in mind. It was also some&#xA;consolation that the Rakshasa king did not&#xA;behave like a beast with her.&#xA;Having despatched his men to&#xA;Janasthana, Ravana returned to Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;presence. He saw her overwhelmed by&#xA;grief and shedding tears. The Rakshasis&#xA;were watching her with care.&#xA;He thought that if she saw his wealth&#xA;and power she would yield to him. She&#xA;was therefore taken round in the great&#xA;palace and shown the wealth and grandeurthere displayed. No king on earth had ever&#xA;possessed such wealth and means of&#xA;enjoyment.&#xA;Sita was shown gold and jewels and&#xA;silks in plenty; curiously wrought&#xA;platforms, vehicles and towers; thousands&#xA;of maid servants and every symbol of&#xA;wealth and royal power. But her thoughts&#xA;were elsewhere.&#xA;Ravana tried to convince her also of&#xA;the vastness of his army. But then she had&#xA;already formed her opinion of his prowess&#xA;and had described it to him in scathing&#xA;terms.&#xA;Yet, Ravana argued: &amp;ldquo;All this you can&#xA;count and enjoy as your own. You shall be&#xA;my queen, dearer to me than life itself. I&#xA;have many wives but you shall be mistress&#xA;of them all. Hereafter my love shall be for&#xA;you and you alone. Listen to me. Do my&#xA;desire. For hundreds of miles the sea&#xA;surrounds this island which is guarded by&#xA;thousands of mighty soldiers. No one can&#xA;enter this city. No one among the gods or&#xA;asuras can match me in might; and they&#xA;know it. What pleasure or honor is it for&#xA;you to stick to a poor human creature&#xA;banished from his kingdom, a destitute&#xA;wandering in the forest? To match your&#xA;beauty, you need my wealth. Do not waste&#xA;the years of our youth. You are never&#xA;again going to set eyes on Rama. Be&#xA;certain of that. Rama cannot approach this&#xA;city. Treat this kingdom as yours. Treat&#xA;me and all the obedient gods as slaves.&#xA;Till now, because of your sins in some&#xA;previous birth, you have suffered&#xA;hardship. Here after you will enjoy with&#xA;me the fruits of your former merits. You&#xA;will be the queen of Lanka and the wife of&#xA;the Lord of Lanka, the conqueror of&#xA;Kubera. Let us take our pleasure floating&#xA;about the world in the Pushpaka vimana.&#xA;Let the cloud of sorrow disappear from&#xA;your face and let the moon of joy appear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Ravana went on speaking thus,&#xA;tears flowed from Sita&amp;rsquo;s eyes. She covered&#xA;her face with the end of her sari as she did&#xA;not want her enemies too think that she&#xA;was afraid.&#xA;Ravana begged and importuned her:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not be shy. There is nothing wrong in&#xA;accepting me, nothing to be ashamed of. It&#xA;is laid down that one should accept the&#xA;gifts of God. O beautiful one! I bow my&#xA;head at your feet and beg you for your&#xA;grace. I am your slave. Forgetting my&#xA;greatness and power, I thus beg for your&#xA;favor. Never in my life have I bowed in&#xA;this way before anyone.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He really thought he could persuade&#xA;her and gain her affection.&#xA;If one&amp;rsquo;s mind is clear, one can&#xA;courageously face any situation. In spite&#xA;of her grief, therefore, Sita spoke boldly to&#xA;the Rakshasa. She placed a little bit of&#xA;grass between Ravana and herself before&#xA;answering him.&#xA;Boastful words were uttered by Ravana&#xA;in sanyasi garb, sitting in front of the fruit&#xA;served by her in Panchavati. Imprisoned&#xA;Sita now spoke as if in echo of those&#xA;words.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Know who I am. Dasaratha was&#xA;famed in all the three worlds and reigned&#xA;long years and stood as a bulwark of&#xA;dharma and defender of truth. His son&#xA;Rama, of godlike presence and lion-like&#xA;valor, is my husband. He and his brother&#xA;Lakshmana will surely take your life. You&#xA;know how Khara and his army were&#xA;destroyed in Janasthana by my lord. As&#xA;easily as an eagle carries a venomous&#xA;serpent, he destroyed your huge army in&#xA;Janasthana. Because you have secured a&#xA;boon that no god or Asura can kill you,&#xA;you have dared to make Rama your&#xA;enemy. You think your boon will save&#xA;you. But I tell you, you cannot escape.&#xA;You will surely meet your death at his&#xA;hands. You are, like the goat tied to thealtar-post for sacrifice, doomed to death.&#xA;The moment Rama sets his angry eyes on&#xA;you, you will meet your fate. My lord will&#xA;dry up the sea or bring down the moon, if&#xA;necessary, to kill you and redeem me. It is&#xA;certain. Your evil deed will bring&#xA;destruction on yourself and your kingdom.&#xA;My noble lord lived unafraid in the midst&#xA;of the Rakshasas in the forest. Like a hero,&#xA;he fought and killed the Rakshasas who&#xA;encountered him. Like a thief, you stole&#xA;me in his absence. But you cannot escape.&#xA;Your fate impelled you to this sin because&#xA;the hour of your ruin and the destruction&#xA;of your race are near. You ask me to&#xA;accept you. How foolish! Can the craw&#xA;approach the swan? Can a heinous sinner&#xA;be allowed near the sacrificial fire? I do&#xA;not value life or body. Do you imagine I&#xA;would wish to live despised by the world?&#xA;Do not dream that out of fear or for saving&#xA;my life I shall yield to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having spoken those words, she was&#xA;silent.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Is that so?&amp;rdquo; said Ravana. &amp;ldquo;Very well&#xA;then, I shall give you twelve months&amp;rsquo; time.&#xA;If you agree to accept me, well and good.&#xA;If at the end of that period, you refuse, my&#xA;cooks will make meat of your body for&#xA;my breakfast.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After warning Sita thus, he gave orders&#xA;to the attendant Rakshasis: &amp;ldquo;You should&#xA;break her pride and obstinacy by some&#xA;means or other. Put her alone in the Asoka&#xA;garden and skillfully use fear and&#xA;temptation to bring her to her senses. As&#xA;we tame a wild she elephant, you should&#xA;train her to submission.&amp;rdquo; And angrily he&#xA;went to his palace.&#xA;The Rakshasis took Sita to the Asoka&#xA;garden. It was a beautiful park attached to&#xA;the women&amp;rsquo;s apartments. The trees were&#xA;full of flowers and fruits, and beautiful&#xA;birds played among them. Here,&#xA;surrounded and guarded by terribly ugly&#xA;Rakshasis, Sita was kept prisoner.&#xA;Though overwhelmed by grief, she had&#xA;the faith that Rama and Lakshmana would&#xA;somehow discover where she was and&#xA;rescue her, that her lord would destroy&#xA;Ravana and take her back to a happy life&#xA;with him.&#xA;Sustained by this faith, she was neither&#xA;frightened by threats nor deceived by&#xA;temptations. Not for one day, or two, but&#xA;for months, Sita suffered thus a close&#xA;prisoner in the Asoka garden.&#xA;The day was yet far off when the&#xA;mighty Hanuman, crossing the sea, would&#xA;visit Sita in her sorrow and bring her the&#xA;message of hope and love and the&#xA;assurance of relief: &amp;ldquo;Rama loves you&#xA;infinitely. He will be here soon. Be not&#xA;afraid.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All the women in our land who suffer&#xA;sorrow in any way are so many replicas of&#xA;Sita. May all the men be like Hanuman,&#xA;pure and heroic helpers of such suffering&#xA;women! We shall now go to Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Maricha was struck by Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrow and was about to die, he resumed&#xA;his own Rakshasa shape and cried aloud&#xA;in a voice which was an exact imitation of&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s: &amp;ldquo;Ah Lakshmana. Ah Sita!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama now realised how the Rakshasa&#xA;had beguiled them and how be had been&#xA;drawn away a long distance by the crafty&#xA;Maricha and he was full of anxiety as to&#xA;what it all could mean.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas, we have been badly deceived. It&#xA;would be terrible if Lakshmana is also&#xA;deceived by this cry and leaves Sita alone&#xA;to come to my succour. It looks as though&#xA;the Rakshasas have planned this ruse to&#xA;carry off Sita and eat her. When Sita hears&#xA;what she will take as my cry of distress&#xA;she is sure to insist on Lakshmana leaving&#xA;her and rushing to my help. The howling&#xA;of jackals and the behavior of birds do&#xA;portend disaster. There is trepidation inmy heart and it is a portent in itself of&#xA;some danger close at hand.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying thus to himself, Rama hurried&#xA;back to the ashrama. On the way, he saw&#xA;Lakshmana running towards him. &amp;ldquo;Alas,&#xA;the worst I fear has happened,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed&#xA;Rama.&#xA;He held Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s hands and cried&#xA;in sorrow: &amp;ldquo;Why did you leave Sita alone&#xA;in the forest, Lakshmana? You may be&#xA;sure the Rakshasas have killed and eaten&#xA;her. It was not right for you to leave her&#xA;and come away. It is now all over with&#xA;Sita!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fatigued and thirsty with the futile&#xA;chase, and now overwhelmed with anger&#xA;and unbearable anxiety, Rama cried again:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If I do not see Sita in the ashrama when&#xA;we return, I shall surely die, Lakshmana.&#xA;You will return to Ayodhya, the survivor&#xA;of us three, and tell them what has&#xA;happened. O, how will Kausalya bear her&#xA;grief? Lakshmana, you have more than&#xA;fulfilled Kaikeyi&amp;rsquo;s wishes. The Rakshasas&#xA;will by now have visited on Sita, poor&#xA;unprotected Sita, all their pent-up hatred&#xA;against us. They must have killed and&#xA;eaten her up by now. How could you&#xA;leave her alone and come away? How&#xA;could you be deceived by Maricha&amp;rsquo;s false&#xA;cry? What shall I do now? I shall see Sita&#xA;no more. The Rakshasas&amp;rsquo; plan has&#xA;succeeded. My trust in you was misplaced&#xA;and I shall never see Sita. How could you&#xA;leave her and come away, how could you,&#xA;Lakshmana?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana answered with tears in his&#xA;eyes: &amp;ldquo;What else, brother, could I do?&#xA;When Sita heard the cry, &amp;lsquo;Alas Sita! Alas&#xA;Lakshmana!&amp;rsquo;&#xA;she&#xA;was&#xA;frightened.&#xA;Quivering with fear she urged me to go to&#xA;you at once and would tolerate no delay.&#xA;She persisted, whatever I said to the&#xA;contrary. I told her again and again not to&#xA;be afraid and assured her that no foe was&#xA;strong enough to do you harm, and that&#xA;the cry of distress was not yours, but she&#xA;would not listen. She charged me with&#xA;having turned traitor to you and with&#xA;having come to the forest with treasonable&#xA;intentions. And, O brother, she found it&#xA;possible in her anguish to say I would be&#xA;glad of your death out of sinful intentions&#xA;towards herself! I was half-dead with&#xA;horror on hearing those words of hers and&#xA;then she announced that she would kill&#xA;herself if I did not go on the instant. Mad&#xA;herself, she maddened me with her words&#xA;of reproach and I ran towards you not&#xA;knowing what else to do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Rama was not satisfied. &amp;ldquo;Whatever&#xA;a foolish woman might have said in her&#xA;fright, you should have stayed and not left&#xA;her unprotected. How could you do such a&#xA;foolish thing? You have brought calamity&#xA;on me. I shall never see Sita again.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The two hurried to the ashrama. Many&#xA;bad omens appeared on their way. And&#xA;Rama repeated, as he saw them one by&#xA;one: &amp;ldquo;I fear, I fear we shall never see Sita&#xA;again!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Reaching the ashrama, they found it, as&#xA;they had feared, empty. Sita was not there.&#xA;The deerskin, the kusa grass, the mat&#xA;spread as a seat, all lay scattered on the&#xA;ground.&#xA;Rama wept and ran hither and thither&#xA;in the grove round the cottage. The leaves&#xA;and flowers on the trees had faded. Sita&#xA;was nowhere to be seen.&#xA;He wandered about like one mad. His&#xA;eyes were bloodshot. He cried, &amp;ldquo;Alas,&#xA;have they eaten her up? Have they carried&#xA;her away? O, bow she must have trembled&#xA;in terror! I cannot bear the thought of it.&#xA;Could it be that she has gone to the river&#xA;to fetch water? Could it be that she has&#xA;gone out to cull flowers? Let us see.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he went searching among the&#xA;trees, hoping that perhaps she was hiding&#xA;and playing a practical joke on him. His&#xA;sorrow swelled like the sea and seemed tohave drowned his reason. He called the&#xA;trees one by one by their names and&#xA;beseeched them for help.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh Asoka tree! Be true to your name,&#xA;remove my sorrow you must know the&#xA;truth. Tell me where Sita is now. Oh tall&#xA;palm tree! You must be able to see where&#xA;Sita is. Tell me where she is.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He talked to the animals too. &amp;ldquo;Oh&#xA;tiger!&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;the elephant and the deer&#xA;are afraid to tell me the truth. But you&#xA;know no fear. You can tell me what has&#xA;happened. You know everything. Tell me&#xA;then the truth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He cried: &amp;ldquo;Oh Sita, you are biding&#xA;somewhere. There! There! I see you there!&#xA;Stop this fooling. I can stand it no longer.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After wandering and weeping in vain&#xA;for a long time he fell on the ground,&#xA;moaning, &amp;ldquo;Ha Lakshmana! Ha Sita!&amp;rdquo; He&#xA;cried like an elephant trapped in a pit.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, Sita is nowhere. The&#xA;Rakshasas have captured her and torn her&#xA;to pieces and eaten her up. How can I live&#xA;any more? My end is near. But when my&#xA;father sees me in the other world, he will&#xA;say, &amp;lsquo;Why have you come here, my son,&#xA;before fulfilling my command?&amp;rsquo; I have&#xA;failed. In everything, I have failed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana could bear this sight no&#xA;longer. &amp;ldquo;Brother, it is not right that you&#xA;should cry like this,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Let us&#xA;search through the forest. You know how&#xA;fond Sita is of entering caves and thickets.&#xA;She may be bathing in the river or playing&#xA;somewhere or culling flowers. Let us&#xA;search again. She is only testing us. Come&#xA;let us search again. Do not cry.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The two searched again all over the&#xA;place on hills, by pools and on the river&#xA;bank. But they did not find her. &amp;ldquo;Sita is&#xA;not to be seen, Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; said Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What shall I do now?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana tried to encourage him&#xA;with words of hope, but Rama was&#xA;inconsolable. &amp;ldquo;No, no, my brother. There&#xA;is no hope,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;Sita is nowhere. I&#xA;have lost her forever. I shall live no&#xA;more.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He lay unconscious for a time. Then he&#xA;came to himself and lifted his voice and&#xA;wept. Nothing that Lakshmana said could&#xA;comfort him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, how can I go back to&#xA;Ayodhya?&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t they laugh at&#xA;me for returning alone after allowing Sita&#xA;to be killed and eaten by Rakshasas?&#xA;Having brought her to the forest and&#xA;having failed to protect her, what shall I&#xA;tell Janaka? No, you should go alone to&#xA;Ayodhya. Go and look after our mothers.&#xA;Greet Bharata from me and tell him it was&#xA;my dying wish that he should continue to&#xA;rule as king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s efforts to console him&#xA;were in vain. He was convinced that the&#xA;Rakshasas had carried away Sita and torn&#xA;her to pieces and eaten her up. He pictured&#xA;to himself in detail the horror of her&#xA;suffering and cried in his grief: &amp;ldquo;I must&#xA;have committed terrible sins. How else&#xA;could such suffering come to me? Sita&#xA;who accompanied me, thinking I could&#xA;protect her, has been eaten by the&#xA;Rakshasas and I can do nothing about it.&#xA;Is there another sinner like me in the&#xA;world?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana said: &amp;ldquo;Do not lose heart.&#xA;You must be bold and energetic. A&#xA;resolute mind can conquer fate. But you&#xA;must first conquer your weakness. Let us&#xA;make a more thorough search of the&#xA;forest. Instead of yielding to unavailing&#xA;sorrow, let us be manly and active.&amp;rdquo; But&#xA;Rama would not listen.&#xA;Rama behaved as a human being, not&#xA;an avatar of Vishnu. Though elsewhere&#xA;his words and actions give room for a&#xA;different view, here Valmiki describes&#xA;Rama as a mere man enveloped in the&#xA;gloom of a supreme misfortune.His feeling and behavior are exactly&#xA;those of any noble and virtuous man who&#xA;has lost his beloved wife, dearer to him&#xA;than life itself, and that in a forest infested&#xA;with Rakshasas. We see that all the efforts&#xA;of Lakshmana to console him had no&#xA;effect.&#xA;Our common human dharma is&#xA;illustrated by the sorrow of Rama. We see&#xA;here the picture of true and equal love&#xA;between a virtuous man and woman and&#xA;the anguish of loss.&#xA;The episode may also be interpreted&#xA;allegorically. Rama&amp;rsquo;s sense of privation,&#xA;when he misses Sita, is a measure and&#xA;image of the mind of God when a single&#xA;human soul is lost through sin.&#xA;One may ask whether God can lose, or&#xA;can suffer pain of mind. If one realises&#xA;that all life is divine leela, the play of&#xA;God, no further exegesis is needed. Sin,&#xA;merit, devotion, all are aspects of that&#xA;sport.&#xA;Each one of us is beloved of the Lord.&#xA;If for any reason we are swept away from&#xA;the right path, He suffers like a lover who&#xA;has lost his love. And His sorrow too is a&#xA;part of His great play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE two brothers searched every&#xA;mountain, forest and riverbank calling&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s name aloud. But all in vain, and&#xA;they did not so much as find a clue&#xA;anywhere. Baffled and grief-stricken,&#xA;Rama cried out against the river Godavari,&#xA;against the gods and against the five&#xA;elements.&#xA;The poet sage ascribes the silence of&#xA;the rivers and the gods and elements to&#xA;their fear of the powerful Rakshasa king.&#xA;A herd of deer, however, moving&#xA;southwards seemed to indicate to Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana that they too should travel&#xA;in the same direction. They did so and,&#xA;after a time, found some flowers scattered&#xA;on the way.&#xA;Rama at once recognised the flowers&#xA;and cried excitedly: &amp;ldquo;These are the very&#xA;flowers I gave her. They must have fallen&#xA;from her hair.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;His grief and anxiety grew greater and&#xA;he sobbed aloud fearing the worst for Sita.&#xA;They searched the forest all around the&#xA;spot where they found the flowers. They&#xA;noticed the marks of a Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s big feet&#xA;and little footprints that they knew were&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;They found some gold beads spilt from&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s jewels. Rama cried again: &amp;ldquo;Look!&#xA;The Rakshasa has been chasing her like a&#xA;beast of prey to tear her tender flesh!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then they saw several fragments of a&#xA;chariot and great clots of blood, as also&#xA;royal headgear and jewels scattered on the&#xA;ground. They wondered what these things&#xA;could mean.&#xA;Soon they came upon a large bow&#xA;broken, flag torn and armor crushed. A&#xA;little later they saw the dead bodies of a&#xA;charioteer and of mules. It was clear that a&#xA;vehement battle had been fought on that&#xA;spot.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Two powerful Rakshasas must have&#xA;struggled here,&amp;rdquo; groaned Rama, &amp;ldquo;each&#xA;claiming the sole right to eat Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Conjecturing and lamenting in this&#xA;way, Rama went on: &amp;ldquo;Dharma could not&#xA;save Sita! No god came to her rescue! It&#xA;will be right to destroy this wicked&#xA;world.&amp;rdquo; Rama was beside himself and&#xA;talked wildly.&#xA;Lakshmana did his best to calm the&#xA;distracted&#xA;Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Great&#xA;sorrow&#xA;unbalances all minds, even the strongest,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said. &amp;ldquo;Else why should you thus lose&#xA;self-control? Why should you hate and&#xA;curse the whole world for the evil deed of&#xA;one person? How often have you, my&#xA;brother, calmed my anger and led me on&#xA;the right path! But now a great grief has&#xA;upset your mind and it is the turn of the&#xA;younger brother to give courage andcounsel patience to the elder and restore&#xA;him to his natural heroism. Let us find out&#xA;who our enemy is and deal with him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With such loving words Lakshmana&#xA;sought to give courage and consolation&#xA;and both walked on. They had not&#xA;proceeded far when they came on Jatayu,&#xA;bloody and mutilated, unrecognisable,&#xA;lying on the ground.&#xA;At first Rama thought it was some&#xA;Rakshasa disguising himself to deceive&#xA;them and, wild with anger, cried: &amp;ldquo;Look!&#xA;Here is a Rakshasa who has eaten Sita!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;and rushed towards him, bow in hand.&#xA;Then raising his ruffled and gory head&#xA;with great pain, Jatayu spoke in a feeble&#xA;voice that seemed struggling with death.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not kill me, dear Rama, who has but a&#xA;few moments more to live! The dear&#xA;princess you are searching for has been&#xA;carried off by Ravana and he could do so&#xA;only by first robbing me of my life!&#xA;Seeing Sita in his flying chariot in the air,&#xA;I intercepted it and gave him battle. I&#xA;struck down his bow and smashed his&#xA;chariot. His charioteer I slew. The marks&#xA;of my last great fight you can see all&#xA;round this place. I did my best. How I&#xA;wish it were better for your sake! At last&#xA;as, weary with toil, I was still waging a&#xA;hopeless combat. Age against youth, beak&#xA;and talons against keen weapons and&#xA;panoply of steel, he cut off my wings and&#xA;legs. And as I fell wounded to death, he&#xA;lifted Sita and flew with her into the sky&#xA;in a southern direction. Though racked&#xA;with the pangs of death, I have clung to&#xA;life for love of you to tell you what I&#xA;know. Now that I have done this, bless me&#xA;and let me die.&amp;rdquo; Tears flowed from&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s eyes as he listened to Jatayu&amp;rsquo;s tale.&#xA;He flung aside his bow and embraced the&#xA;bird. The princes&amp;rsquo; sorrow knew no bounds.&#xA;They lamented loudly, rolling on the&#xA;ground.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am the most unhappy man alive,&#xA;Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. &amp;ldquo;Giving up the&#xA;kingdom, I came to the forest, and here I&#xA;have lost my Sita. This Jatayu, who was a&#xA;second father to us, has, laid down his life&#xA;for my sake. Why, if I fell into the fire, I&#xA;fear my bad luck will put even the fire&#xA;out. If I fell into the sea, I fear it would&#xA;dry up. What a terrible sinner I am,&#xA;Lakshmana! Who knows, one day I might&#xA;lose you too, Lakshmana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Embracing Jatayu, he said: &amp;ldquo;O, my&#xA;father! Really, did you see Sita?&amp;rdquo; But&#xA;Jatayu lay speechless on the ground.&#xA;After a few moments Jatayu spoke&#xA;again in a low voice: &amp;ldquo;Be not afraid,&#xA;Rama. You will surely find Sita. No harm&#xA;will come to her. Regaining the treasure&#xA;you have lost, you will greatly rejoice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With these words, he spat out blood and&#xA;gave up life.&#xA;They were foolish and committed&#xA;errors of omission and commission and&#xA;lost Sita. Trying to save Sita from the&#xA;calamity that their carelessness had&#xA;brought upon her, Jatayu, old, unarmed,&#xA;had fought with wing and beak and talon&#xA;and given up his life. When their father&#xA;died in Ayodhya, his obsequies were&#xA;performed by Bharata and Satrughna.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana. were denied&#xA;this privilege because they were away in&#xA;the forest. They regarded Jatayu as their&#xA;own father and in performing his&#xA;obsequies derived some consolation for&#xA;not being by Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s side and&#xA;performing the last offices to him. What&#xA;other help or honor could they accord to&#xA;heroic Jatayu?&#xA;The bhaktas worship Jatayu as the best&#xA;of bhaktas. Exercising our imagination,&#xA;we should behold with Sita&amp;rsquo;s eyes the poor&#xA;old bird&amp;rsquo;s hard struggle against the&#xA;Rakshasa king. Then we would realise the&#xA;love and gratitude and sorrow that must&#xA;have surged in her heart as she watchedhis sufferings. Thus we shall be purified&#xA;by the grace of the Mother. What wonder&#xA;is there in the rank assigned to Jatayu&#xA;among the bhaktas?&#xA;Later, when Rama fights and is&#xA;victorious in Lanka, Sita does not see it;&#xA;she is a prisoner in the Asoka forest. She&#xA;has to be content with listening to reports&#xA;of the battle and of the prowess of her&#xA;lord. But Jatayu&amp;rsquo;s devotion and heroism&#xA;Sita saw with her own eyes in the&#xA;Dandaka forest. Unarmed, he opposed the&#xA;Rakshasa who had all his weapons and&#xA;armor, and humbled his pride at the cost&#xA;of his own life.&#xA;Jatayu&amp;rsquo;s battle with Ravana is more&#xA;important than the battles in Lanka. Hence&#xA;the pious revere Jatayu along with Bharata&#xA;and look upon him as an Alvar, a guide in&#xA;the spritual path.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; said Rama, &amp;ldquo;gather dry&#xA;faggots. I shall churn the fire. We failed to&#xA;perform our father&amp;rsquo;s obsequies, let us do it&#xA;for the eagle-father who gave up his life&#xA;for us.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The princes chanted holy invocations&#xA;as they poured libations to the departed&#xA;spirit: &amp;ldquo;O king of birds, may you enjoy all&#xA;the bliss of the virtuous who perform great&#xA;sacrifices! May you enjoy the bliss of&#xA;Vanaprasthas who have performed great&#xA;penance! May you enjoy the bliss of those&#xA;who have made great gifts of land! May&#xA;you enjoy the bliss of those who fight&#xA;heroically in the field of battle! May the&#xA;bliss of all good people be yours!&amp;rdquo; After&#xA;the ceremony Rama became steadier and&#xA;stronger in mind.&#xA;To millions of men, women and&#xA;children in India, the Ramayana is not a&#xA;mere tale. It has more truth and meaning&#xA;than the events in one&amp;rsquo;s own life. Just as&#xA;plants grow under the influence of&#xA;sunlight, the people of India grow in&#xA;mental strength and culture by absorbing&#xA;the glowing inspiration of the Ramayana.&#xA;When we see any helpless person in&#xA;danger or difficulty, let us think of Jatayu&#xA;and with firm mind try to help regardless&#xA;of circumstance.&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s losing health and lamenting in&#xA;sorrow may be compared to the behavior&#xA;of another incarnation honored by another&#xA;faith. It is said in the Bible that Jesus,&#xA;nailed to the cross and about to give up his&#xA;ghost, cried with a loud voice: &amp;ldquo;Eloi! Eloi!&#xA;lama sabachthani!&amp;rdquo; which is Hebrew for&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My God, my God, why have you&#xA;forsaken me?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The mystery of incarnations is ever the&#xA;same. They are weighed with the dust and&#xA;tears of the body they have taken and&#xA;suffer and grieve like mortals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN face of the unexpected difficulties&#xA;that overtook them one after another,&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana often lost heart.&#xA;Their fortitude yielded place sometimes to&#xA;great despair. But they managed to&#xA;encourage each other and proceeded on&#xA;their way.&#xA;Passing through the forest, the two&#xA;princes were suddenly caught by a&#xA;tremendously big Rakshasa of ugly form&#xA;without head or feet. His mouth was in his&#xA;great belly and he had two enormous arms&#xA;which, without moving from his place, he&#xA;would stretch out and clutch tiger, bear or&#xA;any other living thing within reach, and&#xA;swallow them.&#xA;He had only one eye which was placed&#xA;in his chest but which was terrible to&#xA;behold.&#xA;Caught by this monster, the princes&#xA;were, for a while, bewildered and did not&#xA;know what to do.&#xA;Then Rama told Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;Let us&#xA;not be confused. You will cut off one arm,&#xA;I shall cut off the other.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And so they did. The name of the&#xA;monster was Kabandha, which means the&#xA;barrel-shaped one. Once his arms weresevered, he was helpless and began to&#xA;explain:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;On account of my evil deeds I was&#xA;cursed by Indra to bear this form and this&#xA;name. I believe you are Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana. Indra promised me freedom&#xA;from the curse when you two should come&#xA;and cut off my arms and commit this body&#xA;of mine to the flames.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The princes set fire to his body as&#xA;desired by the unfortunate monster and&#xA;there arose from the flames a lovely being&#xA;which entered a heavenly chariot and&#xA;ascended to the celestial world.&#xA;Before going, he said to Rama: &amp;ldquo;You&#xA;will assuredly regain Sita. Go to the&#xA;beautiful banks of the Pampa and seek the&#xA;help of Sugriva living there on the&#xA;Rishyamuka hill. Driven out of the&#xA;kingdom by his brother Vali, he lives in&#xA;constant fear and danger. Gain his&#xA;friendship, and you will succeed in your&#xA;attempt.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying&#xA;this&#xA;Kabandha&#xA;disappeared.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana now set forward&#xA;in the direction of the Pampa. In that&#xA;lovely region they visited the ashrama of&#xA;the aged sanyasini, Sabari, the disciple of&#xA;Rishi Matanga, and accepted her&#xA;hospitality. Sabari was a woman of a&#xA;forest tribe and a faithful serving sister in&#xA;the ashrama of the old saint Matanga.&#xA;When he departed this life, she wanted to&#xA;die too. But he said the time was not yet&#xA;and she should await the arrival of Rama,&#xA;an incarnation of Vishnu, for the bliss of&#xA;his darshan was in store for her.&#xA;So the old and wrinkled woman lived&#xA;her saintly life, looking faithfully after the&#xA;ashrama as of old and keeping it sweet to&#xA;receive the promised guest.&#xA;When the princes came, she produced&#xA;the fruits she had gathered and kept for&#xA;them, and described and showed to them&#xA;the wonders of the Matanga ashrama.&#xA;Then with their leave, she kindled a fire&#xA;and entering it ascended to heaven.&#xA;The meeting with this saintly woman&#xA;and the waters of the river Pampa gave&#xA;strength of mind to the princes. They&#xA;thought over what should be done next.&#xA;Said Rama: &amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, I am&#xA;beginning to think that we shall succeed.&#xA;Let us search the forest for Sugriva whose&#xA;help we should obtain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They went all over the Pampa area.&#xA;The place was lovely, but the loveliness of&#xA;the spot and the animals, birds, trees and&#xA;creepers only increased Rama&amp;rsquo;s grief.&#xA;Every beautiful object wrung his heart&#xA;and made him think: &amp;ldquo;How much would&#xA;Sita have enjoyed this?&amp;rdquo; Try as he might,&#xA;he could not control the human sorrow&#xA;which by his incarnation he had&#xA;undertaken to endure.&#xA;Lakshmana tried to revive his spirit. He&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Even if Sita is kept hidden in the&#xA;womb of Aditi, the mother of the gods, we&#xA;will discover her. Ravana cannot escape.&#xA;It is certain we shall kill him and redeem&#xA;Sita. It is not proper that you should thus&#xA;despair. How can you let anxiety or&#xA;weakness come over you? If we lose a&#xA;precious thing, we should work for its&#xA;recovery with perseverance. Sometimes&#xA;our very affection becomes our enemy.&#xA;Too much love brings on grief and grief&#xA;weakens effort. What need is there for me&#xA;to tell you all this? You know it all. Let us&#xA;not lose hope. Let us forget the grief&#xA;brought on by love and bend our mind and&#xA;body to exertion. Be brave. Be hopeful.&#xA;We shall succeed. Get rid of your sorrow,&#xA;brother!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The younger brother thus advised&#xA;Rama.&#xA;Commentators&#xA;look&#xA;upon&#xA;Lakshmana as Adisesha. Adisesha, the&#xA;serpent, is said to be ever the protecting&#xA;spirit of Vishnu. So Lakshmana ever tried&#xA;to give Rama fresh energy and&#xA;enthusiasm.The fugitive Vanara prince Sugriva and&#xA;his faithful adherents with the watchful&#xA;vigilance of fear saw Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana roving in the forests and were&#xA;troubled with doubts. Having been ejected&#xA;from his kingdom by Vali, Sugriva chose&#xA;this mountainous spot because he believed&#xA;that it was made by the curse of a rishi&#xA;inaccessible to Vali. And now he feared&#xA;that here, too, Vali in disguise was&#xA;following him in order to kill him.&#xA;Or else, he feared, some Kshatriya&#xA;warriors taking the side of Vali were there&#xA;to kill him. The other Vanaras ran hither&#xA;and thither in panic.&#xA;Hanuman was Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s chief minister.&#xA;He reassured Sugriva, saying: &amp;ldquo;This is not&#xA;Vali, nor are they friends of Vali, it seems&#xA;to me. There is no ground for fear. I shall&#xA;go and talk to them and find out the truth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva was pleased and said: &amp;ldquo;Do it,&#xA;but be careful. Go, find out the truth and&#xA;come back. Use all your skill. I am full of&#xA;suspicion. They behave as if they are&#xA;searching for someone. Could it not be&#xA;that it is me they seek?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Taking the form of a brahmana,&#xA;Hanuman&#xA;approached&#xA;Rama&#xA;and&#xA;Lakshmana. As he went and stood in front&#xA;of them, a confident feeling possessed his&#xA;heart. Straight away he started speaking&#xA;out frankly.&#xA;Hanuman went forward to learn the&#xA;truth without discovering himself. But as&#xA;he went on speaking, he threw all caution&#xA;away and told in detail all about himself&#xA;and the Vanara King.&#xA;Looking on Rama and Lakshmana, he&#xA;was beside himself as a devotee in the&#xA;presence of the Lord, and praised them.&#xA;He said that he was a Vanara and had&#xA;come there in disguise as desired by his&#xA;King.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Royal saints,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;your presence&#xA;here fills my heart with joy. There is an&#xA;aura round you as if you were gods. I take&#xA;it, you are here in the forest for doing&#xA;tapas. But why have you come to this&#xA;inaccessible spot? Please tell me who you&#xA;are. This river and this forest are made&#xA;lovelier by your presence. Your faces and&#xA;forms are radiantly beautiful. The&#xA;creatures in the forest look on you with&#xA;reverence and awe. Your strength and&#xA;courage are manifest. Who are you? From&#xA;which country do you come? It is clear&#xA;you are entitled by birth to rule some&#xA;mighty kingdom and yet you are dressed&#xA;like ascetics. With matted hair and bark&#xA;garments you carry also bows and arrows.&#xA;Why are you silent? Here Sugriva, the&#xA;Vanara King, driven out of his kingdom&#xA;by his brother Vali, is in hiding. He is full&#xA;of grief. I am his minister. My name is&#xA;Hanuman. I am the son of Vayu. As&#xA;ordered by my king, I put on the&#xA;appearance of a brahmachari and am now&#xA;here before you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening to these courteous words of&#xA;Hanuman, Rama said to Lakshmana:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Brother, this speech of Hanuman has&#xA;inspired me with confidence. I trust him&#xA;absolutely. Did you notice the beauty of&#xA;his language and how correct and&#xA;rhythmic his enunciation is? He speaks&#xA;like one who has mastered the Vedas and&#xA;the science of grammar. An ideal&#xA;messenger he is. Fortunate is the king who&#xA;has such a messenger. He whom we are&#xA;searching for is himself in search of us.&#xA;We came here to see Sugriva and he has&#xA;sent this messenger to us. Let us welcome&#xA;him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then they began to talk freely to one&#xA;another. Rama and Lakshmana on the one&#xA;hand and Hanuman on the other related&#xA;their history, their joys and sorrows, hopes&#xA;and fears.&#xA;As a result of this talk, Lakshmana&#xA;conceived a great affection for Hanuman.&#xA;He said to Hanuman: &amp;ldquo;My brother,&#xA;born to great wealth, the eldest son of anemperor, has left his kingdom and come&#xA;to the forest. Here his wife, dearer to him&#xA;than life itself, was abducted by Ravana,&#xA;who had by a fraudulent trick inveigled us&#xA;far away from the hermitage where she&#xA;was. We seek Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s help to rescue her&#xA;and recover her, for a daitya, who under a&#xA;curse took on the form of a Rakshasa, told&#xA;us: &amp;lsquo;If you secure the help of Sugriva, the&#xA;Vanara King, you will regain the princess&#xA;stolen by the Rakshasa.&amp;rsquo; And so we are&#xA;here. We seek the friendship of your&#xA;king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman answered: &amp;ldquo;Sugriva too has&#xA;been persecuted by Vali and deprived of&#xA;his kingdom and his wife. It is now certain&#xA;that he will regain both. My king will gain&#xA;much by your friendship and with his help&#xA;you will also succeed in your efforts.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then the three went to Sugriva. The&#xA;way was such that only a Vanara could&#xA;traverse it. Hanuman resumed his natural&#xA;shape and carried both the princes on his&#xA;back.&#xA;The hearts of good men meet and&#xA;instantly come together. As the Kural&#xA;says, the spontaneous mutual attraction of&#xA;two hearts and not long acquaintance&#xA;creates friendship and this friendship was&#xA;part of the divine dispensation. It was&#xA;predestined that Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s sublime&#xA;devotion should be at Rama&amp;rsquo;s service for&#xA;the fulfilment of the purpose of the&#xA;incarnation. And so there was acceptance&#xA;at first sight.&#xA;His carrying the two princes on his&#xA;shoulder was an outward symbol of&#xA;inward union. As friends and lovers&#xA;embrace each other, Hanuman, the loving&#xA;servant, rejoiced in carrying his Lord on&#xA;his shoulders.&#xA;Ascending the Malaya hill, Hanuman&#xA;went in advance to Sugriva and,&#xA;announcing the visit of Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rama is a prince full of wisdom and&#xA;virtue. He is the eldest son of the famous&#xA;Emperor Dasaratha. To fulfil his father&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;promise, he left Ayodhya with his brother&#xA;and wife and came to the forest. King&#xA;Dasaratha was compelled by his younger&#xA;wife, in fulfilment of an undefined&#xA;promise given long ago, to banish Rama.&#xA;In the forest, taking advantage of the&#xA;princes&amp;rsquo; absence, Ravana carried away the&#xA;wife of Rama. Rama has come here,&#xA;seeking your help in finding her. The&#xA;princes are worthy of your friendship.&#xA;You too will gain greatly from friend ship&#xA;with such heroes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva assumed the form of a&#xA;handsome man and had a long and heart-&#xA;to-heart talk with the princes. Stretching&#xA;forth his hand to Rama, he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Princes, if you care for the friendship&#xA;of a Vanara, here is my hand, accept it.&#xA;Hanuman has told me all about your&#xA;virtue and greatness.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama clasped his hand and embraced&#xA;him. Soon Hanuman got together some&#xA;faggots&#xA;and&#xA;kindled&#xA;a&#xA;fire.&#xA;Circumambulating the flames Rama and&#xA;Sugriva swore mutual friendship: &amp;ldquo;Let us&#xA;share our joys and sorrows.&amp;rdquo; They vowed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let our friendship be eternal.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They cut down the branch of a tree and&#xA;sitting on it, Rama and Sugriva were&#xA;engaged in cheerful talk and so, too, were&#xA;Hanuman and Lakshmana seated on&#xA;another. Sugriva narrated the story of his&#xA;life. How greatly he and his elder brother,&#xA;the mighty Vali, were once devoted to one&#xA;another, and how malignant fate had&#xA;through no fault of Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s made deadly&#xA;enemies of them.&#xA;It had comes about this way. Once a&#xA;Rakshasa named Mayavi came at&#xA;midnight to the gate of Kishkindha, their&#xA;capital, and vauntingly challenged Vali to&#xA;instant combat in pursuance of an ancient&#xA;feud.Vali, who never refused a fight, rushed&#xA;forth impetuously, followed by Sugriva;&#xA;and seeing them, the Rakshasa fled.&#xA;Pursuing him they saw him disappear into&#xA;a great cave the mouth of which was&#xA;overgrown with brushwood. Vali bade&#xA;Sugriva, exacting an oath from him, to&#xA;wait at the entrance for him and plunged&#xA;into the darkness of the cave after the foe.&#xA;Sugriva waited long, but Vali did not&#xA;come out. As he stood racked with doubt,&#xA;indistinct shouts and groans, which&#xA;seemed to his horror-struck ears his&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s, issued from the cave. Presently&#xA;there gushed out of it foaming blood&#xA;which made him sure that Vali had&#xA;perished in the struggle.&#xA;To make sure that the victorious&#xA;Rakshasa would not rush out in the elation&#xA;of triumph and destroy Kishkindha,&#xA;Sugriva blocked the entrance of the cave&#xA;with a huge rock and returned to&#xA;Kishkindha with his tale of Vali&amp;rsquo;s death.&#xA;As a rulerless state invites disaster, he was&#xA;persuaded by the ministers and elders to&#xA;occupy the vacant throne.&#xA;While he was enjoying the sweets of&#xA;power, like a bolt from the blue, Vali&#xA;burst on them. Haggard with wrath and&#xA;wounds, and accusing him of treason and&#xA;unnatural conduct towards one who was at&#xA;once his brother and his king, Vali drove&#xA;him out with scorn and contumely as a&#xA;wretch too vile to live, but whom he&#xA;forebore to slay only because he was&#xA;unfortunately also his brother.&#xA;So by a cruel fate he had been deprived&#xA;of his home, throne, and all, including&#xA;even his wife, and had to seek asylum in&#xA;the forest with a few faithful friends. Here&#xA;at least he was safe, for Vali had been&#xA;forbidden by a rishi from entering the&#xA;precincts on pain of instant death.&#xA;This incident between Vali and Sugriva&#xA;is a good example of the moral teaching&#xA;conveyed in the Puranas. There was&#xA;nothing terribly wrong in the conduct&#xA;either of Vali or of Sugriva. Anger&#xA;confuses the mind. One who yields to&#xA;anger loses the capacity to see the truth.&#xA;That way lies destruction. Vali&amp;rsquo;s anger led&#xA;to his end. Sugriva humbly confessed the&#xA;truth, but Vali would not listen.&#xA;He was beside himself with rage.&#xA;Sugriva too, was guilty of imprudent&#xA;haste. He concluded too quickly that his&#xA;brother had died. He was afraid that the&#xA;Asura who was victorious would come&#xA;out and kill him also. So he closed the&#xA;entrance of the cave and returned home.&#xA;At first he was not keen on becoming king&#xA;and yet he allowed himself to be&#xA;persuaded by the people.&#xA;He yielded to a subconscious desire&#xA;without sufficient thought. So difficulties&#xA;came upon him. Thoughtless action leads&#xA;to unhappiness. This is what we learn&#xA;from the story of Sugriva. One should not&#xA;desire what belongs to another. One has to&#xA;exercise great care, and control one&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;desires.&#xA;In contrast to Sugriva, when the&#xA;ministers and subjects in Ayodhya pressed&#xA;Bharata to accept the crown, he was firm&#xA;in his refusal. Bharata&amp;rsquo;s strength of&#xA;character was great. But Sugriva was&#xA;different. He was weak, and suffered in&#xA;consequence. Bharata had the courage to&#xA;refuse and his name lives forever.&#xA;In every episode of the Ramayana&#xA;some lesson which we should learn for&#xA;our daily life is taught. The meaning is in&#xA;some places plain; in others it may lie&#xA;hidden. If we read with reverence and&#xA;think deeply, we can always see the&#xA;moral.&#xA;Sugriva concluded his story with a&#xA;piteous appeal to Rama. &amp;ldquo;For fear of Vali I&#xA;am a wanderer in the forest. I live&#xA;concealing myself here. Could you, will&#xA;you, kill Vali and restore to me my&#xA;kingdom and my wife?&amp;ldquo;Rama answered: &amp;ldquo;Certainly I will. Vali&#xA;cannot escape this now. Be assured.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Sugriva and Rama were talking&#xA;thus, in the Asoka grove far away, the left&#xA;eyelids of Sita throbbed, which is a good&#xA;omen for women. At the same time, the&#xA;left eyelids of the Rakshasa king also&#xA;throbbed as an evil sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THEN Sugriva heard the story of the&#xA;calamity that had befallen the Raghu&#xA;princes at Panchavati and how Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;heart was breaking with the ache of&#xA;separation from Sita and anxiety as to her&#xA;fate. Deeply touched, Sugriva tried to&#xA;console Rama. &amp;ldquo;I have heard everything&#xA;from Lakshmana,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Lay aside all&#xA;doubts and fears. We shall surely discover&#xA;Sita, wherever she may be concealed, and&#xA;that, soon. My companions and myself&#xA;noticed a Rakshasa carrying a weeping&#xA;lady and speeding fast across the sky. She&#xA;was crying &amp;lsquo;O Rama! O Lakshmana!&amp;rsquo; She&#xA;too noticed us and, removing her sash,&#xA;tied up in it her jewels and threw down the&#xA;little bundle. We picked up and have kept&#xA;it. See if the jewels are Sita&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On hearing this Rama excitedly&#xA;shouted: &amp;ldquo;Fetch the bundle, fetch it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They brought it from the cave and&#xA;when Rama saw the sash he was beside&#xA;himself with grief. The little bundle&#xA;brought before his eyes the suffering of&#xA;Sita at the hands of the Rakshasa.&#xA;He closed his eyes and told Lakshmana&#xA;to untie the bundle and examine the jewels&#xA;since he himself could not bear to look at&#xA;them.&#xA;Lakshmana did so. &amp;ldquo;Indeed these are&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s anklets,&amp;rdquo; LakShmana said. &amp;ldquo;There is&#xA;no doubt they are hers. These I know, for&#xA;often have I seen them while laying my&#xA;head on her feet in worship. The others I&#xA;am not familiar with, never having&#xA;presumed to look closely at them.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;How full of loving reverence is this&#xA;speech which Valmiki puts in the mouth&#xA;of Lakshmana and how cruelly must Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;unjust words have pierced his heart on the&#xA;fateful day when she drove him from her.&#xA;Rama took all the jewels in his hands&#xA;and pressed them one by one to his eyes.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;They must have fallen on the&#xA;soft grass and so they are intact.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then, grief giving place to rage, he&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Yama&amp;rsquo;s gates are wide open to&#xA;receive the Rakshasa. Soon will he be&#xA;destroyed with all his people.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Seeing Rama&amp;rsquo;s grief and wrath, Sugriva&#xA;became somewhat anxious. Though their&#xA;mutual friendship and help had been&#xA;pledged in the presence of the sacred fire,&#xA;Sugriva was concerned over the question&#xA;of priorities.&#xA;Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s heart went to Rama in his&#xA;suffering, indeed, he himself knew what it&#xA;was to lose kingdom and wife. But then,&#xA;first thing must come first. He must&#xA;approach the subject guardedly and not&#xA;seem to place his own affairs before&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s. That might jeopardise their&#xA;newborn friendship. But it was not purely&#xA;selfish to say that he, as King of&#xA;Kishkindha and lord of his tribe, would be&#xA;a far more serviceable ally than he could&#xA;be as a fugitive pretender.&#xA;Besides, if he launched on the&#xA;enterprise of reclaiming Sita when Vali&#xA;was still king of the Vanaras, one could&#xA;not guess what Vali&amp;rsquo;s course may be. Oh&#xA;no! There could be no doubt that the first&#xA;move in the enterprise must be to secure&#xA;the resources of the Vanara kingdom by&#xA;killing Vali and placing himself on the&#xA;throne.&#xA;This alone would bring success to&#xA;Rama as well as himself. But realising&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s state of mind, he resolved to act&#xA;with circumspection.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;I do not know the strength or&#xA;the dwelling place of this wickedRakshasa. We do not know where he has&#xA;taken Sita and where he keeps her hidden.&#xA;Still, I promise you solemnly, wherever&#xA;Sita may be, I shall find her and her captor&#xA;and find ways of destroying him and&#xA;recovering her. You will kill the wicked&#xA;Rakshasa and win glory. Do not despair or&#xA;yield to grief that weakens the spirit. Look&#xA;at me. Like you, I have lost my wife. I&#xA;have been turned out of my kingdom and&#xA;disgraced. And yet I control my sorrow&#xA;and keep my courage up. If I a Vanara,&#xA;can do this, it should be far easier for you.&#xA;If sorrow overwhelms, one becomes&#xA;helpless and can do nothing. Therefore,&#xA;friend, I beg of you to control your grief.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These words of Sugriva made an&#xA;impression on Rama&amp;rsquo;s heart. He wiped the&#xA;tears off his eyes and embraced Sugriva.&#xA;He got over the weakness that possessed&#xA;him at the sight of Sita&amp;rsquo;s jewels and&#xA;recovered his fortitude and self-control.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sugriva, your friendship is dear to&#xA;me,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I shall follow your advice.&#xA;Think out when and how we should begin&#xA;the search for Sita. I shall make your&#xA;cause mine, and place you on the throne&#xA;of Kishkindha and I, who say this, have&#xA;never uttered a vain or false word in my&#xA;life and never will. Tell me frankly how I&#xA;can bring you relief. I shall do it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva and his ministers were&#xA;overjoyed to hear Rama&amp;rsquo;s words. They&#xA;were convinced that soon their troubles&#xA;would end and Sugriva would once again&#xA;become king of the Vanaras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUGRIVA was keen on regaining his&#xA;kingdom and family, but he could not see&#xA;how this was to be. Vali&amp;rsquo;s strength stood&#xA;as an impossible barrier between him and&#xA;the fulfilment of his desire.&#xA;Hanuman, his minister, tried to&#xA;convince him that is would succeed with&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s help, but Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s doubts&#xA;persisted.&#xA;Could&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;strength&#xA;overcome Vali&amp;rsquo;s? It all looked hopelessly&#xA;impossible. Vali&amp;rsquo;s body was like steel.&#xA;How was Rama going to kill him?&#xA;Sugriva had these doubts about Rama.&#xA;But he had none else to help him. And he&#xA;was not prepared to give up his desire. He&#xA;decided to test Rama&amp;rsquo;s strength.&#xA;But how is one to subject a friend to a&#xA;test without discourteously betraying one&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;suspicion? Rama had promised to get the&#xA;thing done. How was an occasion to be&#xA;created to measure his ability? Sugriva&#xA;thought long and formed a plan.&#xA;He told Rama softly: &amp;ldquo;My Lord Rama!&#xA;Your words have banished sorrow from&#xA;my heart. I know your valor. An arrow&#xA;from your bow can destroy the three&#xA;worlds. How can Vali&amp;rsquo;s frame stand&#xA;against it? Still it is my duty to tell you all&#xA;about Vali&amp;rsquo;s strength. He can go round to&#xA;the four oceans to take up in his palm and&#xA;sip the water with the morning prayers.&#xA;He can toss and play with a heavy rock as&#xA;if it were a ball. He can pull out mighty&#xA;forest trees as if they were blades of grass.&#xA;Once Dundubhi, an Asura in buffalo form&#xA;possessing the strength of a thousand&#xA;elephants, challenged Ocean to a fight.&#xA;Ocean evaded saying: &amp;lsquo;You should fight&#xA;with an equal. There in the north stands&#xA;Himavan. Go and challenge him. Leave&#xA;poor me alone&amp;rsquo;. Dundubhi agreed and,&#xA;speeding northwards, met and challenged&#xA;Himavan, going his rocky side with his&#xA;horns. Himavan controlled his temper and&#xA;said: &amp;lsquo;Why do you assault me? I am not a&#xA;fighter. I spend my life in the company of&#xA;sages who love to stay with me.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Dundubhi answered: &amp;lsquo;Very well, then. But&#xA;tell me of some one I can fight with. I&#xA;want a worthy foeman today.&amp;rsquo; Himavan&#xA;said: &amp;lsquo;There is one in the south who is a&#xA;foe worthy of you. He is Vali, the Vanara&#xA;King. His strength is like his father&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s. If you care, you may go to himand challenge him to fight.&amp;rsquo; Dundubhi&#xA;went straight to Vali&amp;rsquo;s place and raised a&#xA;loud uproar at the entrance of Kishkindha.&#xA;He tore up trees and pulled down the gate&#xA;and roared, &amp;lsquo;Come out and prove your&#xA;strength in a fight with me.&amp;rsquo; Vali was then&#xA;resting with his queen. On hearing the&#xA;challenge he came out accompanied by&#xA;the women of his palace. &amp;lsquo;Why, O&#xA;Dundubhi, do you raise this clamor at my&#xA;city gate?&amp;rsquo; be asked. &amp;lsquo;Are you tired of life?&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Vali&amp;rsquo;s scornful address enraged the Asura&#xA;who said: &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t boast of your strength in&#xA;the presence of your admiring women. I&#xA;have come here for a fight with you. If&#xA;you have any manliness in you, come out&#xA;and show it. You will say you are too&#xA;drunk now to fight; but I am willing to&#xA;wait till you become sober. If you like you&#xA;may spend the night in your pleasures and&#xA;bid a tearful leave of all your dear ones&#xA;and come to me in the morning to be slain&#xA;by me.&amp;rsquo; Vali laughed at Dundubhi&amp;rsquo;s words&#xA;and said: &amp;lsquo;My dear women, go inside. O&#xA;Asura, I am not the worse for drink and if&#xA;you want a fight, there is no time like the&#xA;present. The drinks I have had are what&#xA;the warrior takes before he goes into&#xA;battle!&amp;rsquo; So saying and with a laugh he took&#xA;hold of the Asura by his tail and whirled&#xA;him round and flung him. Dundubhi spat&#xA;blood and fell on the ground. After a&#xA;while the Asura rose again and a great&#xA;battle followed. Vali, son of Indra,&#xA;pounded the Asura to death. And he flung&#xA;the dead buffalo so that it fell on the&#xA;ground at the distance of a yojana. Drops&#xA;of blood from the Asura&amp;rsquo;s body were&#xA;carried by the wind and fell on the&#xA;ashrama of Matanga. The sage was wroth&#xA;and soon found out who was responsible&#xA;for this contamination. He saw at once&#xA;that Vali in his pride had flung a bleeding&#xA;carcass and desecrated the holy spot. The&#xA;sage pronounced a curse, &amp;lsquo;If this Vali&#xA;enters the precincts of this ashrama, he&#xA;will lose his life.&amp;rsquo; That is why, O Rama,&#xA;with my friends I am living here in safety.&#xA;Vali dare not approach this place for fear&#xA;of the curse. Look at these sal trees. He&#xA;can pluck one of them and just shake all&#xA;the leaves off as one dusts a jacket. Such&#xA;is his strength. How could I, having&#xA;incurred this terrible brother&amp;rsquo;s enmity, feel&#xA;secure?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana understood that Sugriva&#xA;needed a demonstration of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;prowess to give him confidence and he&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;How would you like Rama to show&#xA;you his confidence to conquer Vali?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva answered: &amp;ldquo;Indeed, I have no&#xA;doubts. I know Rama&amp;rsquo;s prowess though&#xA;now it is hidden as embers in ashes. I have&#xA;sought refuge under him. And yet, when I&#xA;recall Vali&amp;rsquo;s mighty deeds, I tremble. That&#xA;is all.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Seeing Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s faith in him and his&#xA;great fear of Vali, Rama resolved to put an&#xA;end to his doubts. By a playful flip of his&#xA;toe he sent the enormous skeleton of&#xA;Dundubhi which was lying there, flying in&#xA;the air to a distance of ten yojanas. But&#xA;Sugriva though impressed was not&#xA;convinced. &amp;ldquo;When my brother sent&#xA;Dundubhi&amp;rsquo;s carcass hurling in the sky, it&#xA;was full of flesh and blood and far heavier&#xA;than this weather-beaten skeleton,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said.&#xA;Then Rama bent his bow and, pulling&#xA;the string to his ear, sent forth an arrow. It&#xA;pierced the sal tree pointed out by Sugriva&#xA;and six other trees standing behind it.&#xA;Piercing the seven trees the beautiful&#xA;arrow touched the earth and returned to&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s quiver.&#xA;Sugriva, seeing this, was beside&#xA;himself with joy. He was now certain that&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrow could pierce the adamant&#xA;frame of Vali. He fell prostrate before&#xA;Rama and said: &amp;ldquo;With my own eyes I have&#xA;now seen your prowess. Even if all the&#xA;gods with Indra at their head should comeand oppose you, your victory is certain.&#xA;Why then talk of Vali? I have gained your&#xA;friendship and I have no more use for fear&#xA;or grief. Slay Vali and save me. Let us go&#xA;to Kishkindha today.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Both Rama and Lakshmana agreed.&#xA;They talked how to set about and it was&#xA;finally agreed that Sugriva should appear&#xA;in Kishkindha and challenge Vali to single&#xA;combat. Vali was sure to come out, and as&#xA;the brothers were fighting, Rama would&#xA;kill Vali with an arrow. They proceeded to&#xA;Kishkindha. Sugriva went ahead. Rama&#xA;followed him and stood away behind a&#xA;tree in the dense forest.&#xA;Sugriva shouted. Vali heard the shout&#xA;and in great rage emerged from the&#xA;fortress, radiant like the morning sun.&#xA;The two brothers fought each other&#xA;fiercely.&#xA;But Rama, who was standing bow in&#xA;hand behind a tree, was bewildered. As&#xA;they wrestled together the brothers were&#xA;so similar in form and feature, in&#xA;equipment and method of fighting, that&#xA;Rama could not distinguish Vali from&#xA;Sugriva and was afraid to shoot lest he kill&#xA;the wrong combatant.&#xA;Meantime Sugriva, having the worst of&#xA;the fight, broke from his brother&amp;rsquo;s grip&#xA;with a desperate effort and, wounded and&#xA;weary, disappointed and despondent, fled&#xA;for life and reached Rishyamuka forest.&#xA;Even this he was able to do because&#xA;Vali did not wish to slay him and was not&#xA;unwilling to give his brother another lease&#xA;of life.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana rejoined the&#xA;woebegone Sugriva. He looked down at&#xA;the ground without lifting his eyes. He&#xA;was angry that Rama had broken his word&#xA;and failed to help him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you did not like to kill Vali,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Sugriva, &amp;ldquo;you could have told me so&#xA;earlier. In that case, I, who know Vali&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;might, would never have challenged him&#xA;to fight. On the contrary, you made me&#xA;believe you, and I have had such a&#xA;drubbing that it is a wonder I am alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Do not be angry, Sugriva, but listen,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Rama. &amp;ldquo;There was a good reason why&#xA;I could not send forth my deadly arrow.&#xA;You and Vali were alike in height and&#xA;girth, in gait and shouts, in dress and&#xA;ornaments. Once the fight began, I could&#xA;not tell you from Vali. And I stood&#xA;bewildered and helpless. It would have&#xA;been terrible if I killed you instead of&#xA;Vali. Do not be angry. Challenge Vali&#xA;once again. This time I shall surely slay&#xA;him. Here, Lakshmana, fetch that&#xA;flowering creeper. Tie it round Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;neck as a garland. I shall then know who&#xA;is our friend and who is Vali as they fight.&#xA;Now, Sugriva, you shall see Vali rolling&#xA;on the ground.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva was satisfied. His spirits&#xA;recovered. Lakshmana tied the creeper&#xA;round his neck. Once again, and&#xA;handsomer than ever, Sugriva proceeded&#xA;to Kishkindha. And Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;followed him as before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>43 THE SLAYING OF VALI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EVENING was approaching. Once&#xA;more Sugriva roared at the gate of&#xA;Kishkindha and challenged Vali to fight.&#xA;Vali who was then resting happily was&#xA;startled and for a moment paled with&#xA;puzzled concern, but was presently&#xA;overwhelmed with rage and sprung&#xA;stamping the earth as though he would&#xA;split it.&#xA;Tara, his queen, her heart full of loving&#xA;fear, held him in arms in a close embrace&#xA;and tried to restrain his impetuosity with&#xA;affectionate counsel. &amp;ldquo;Put away this wrath,&#xA;my dear lord, as one puts away a used&#xA;garland, for you have had enough fighting&#xA;today. Tomorrow would do as well for&#xA;another battle, for you lack neither&#xA;enemies nor valor. I pray you not to rush&#xA;out on the instant. It seems to me that youshould think calmly before going out now&#xA;to meet your brother. I am afraid there is a&#xA;deeper game. Your brother was defeated&#xA;and disgraced and ran for dear life and&#xA;concealed himself for safety. Now he has&#xA;returned and raises this noise. Your&#xA;brother is not such a fool as to challenge&#xA;you again so soon after the punishment&#xA;you inflicted on him unless he was&#xA;assured of help and protection from an&#xA;invincible ally of tried prowess. Did you&#xA;not observe that his very roar of challenge&#xA;had a new note of confidence in it? I shall&#xA;tell you what I heard from Angada who&#xA;had it from our scouts who range the&#xA;forests. Two princes of unrivalled valor,&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana have come from&#xA;Ayodhya and Sugriva has secured the&#xA;promise of their assistance. After all, my&#xA;lord, your brother is virtuous and brave.&#xA;Why should you hate him? Who in the&#xA;world is closer to us than he? He will be&#xA;your devoted servant and strong ally. It is&#xA;best to forget the past and make it up with&#xA;Sugriva. My dear Lord, listen to my&#xA;words!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vali disliked this advice. Anger&#xA;clouded his intellect. Caught and dragged&#xA;by the noose of death, he could not see&#xA;reason and only became more fixed in his&#xA;resolve.&#xA;Tara, bright and beautiful as became&#xA;her name Tara meaning star, spoke in&#xA;vain.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What are you saying?&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Am I&#xA;to hear in silence the ringing challenge of&#xA;this enemy-brother? When a foe calls to&#xA;battle is a warrior to hang back? Death&#xA;would be better than such cowardice.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t you worry about Rama. He knows&#xA;dharma; he is one brought up in the fear of&#xA;sin. Oh, let me alone, will you? I may tell&#xA;you I shall not kill Sugriva, only I will&#xA;teach the presumptuous fellow a lesson he&#xA;won&amp;rsquo;t forget and let him go. Let me go, I&#xA;tell you. You have spoken out of the&#xA;fullness of your love for me. I shall&#xA;humble Sugriva and send him back and&#xA;return soon with victory. Have no fear for&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Valmiki pictures Vali, his&#xA;chivalry, his dauntless and impatient&#xA;valor, his tenderness. It is true Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hero has to kill the Vanara king, the epic&#xA;requires it. But the slain warrior was a&#xA;noble knight, worthy of the reader&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;admiration and tears.&#xA;Tara, with tears in her eyes,&#xA;circumambulated him and praying for his&#xA;success returned to her apartment full of&#xA;grave apprehension. Leaving Tara and her&#xA;companions behind, Vali issued from the&#xA;fort hissing like an angry cobra and went&#xA;to meet Sugriva.&#xA;As he saw him standing there, radiant&#xA;and courageous, he girt his loins and&#xA;sprang on him. And Sugriva too ran&#xA;forward to meet Vali.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If you love your life,&amp;rdquo; warned Vali,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;run away. Do not fall a victim to this fist&#xA;of mine!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva retorted angrily and the battle&#xA;began. Fierce with remembered wrongs&#xA;and keyed up above himself by the&#xA;certainty of Rama&amp;rsquo;s help, Sugriva&#xA;maintained for long an equal combat. But&#xA;presently Vali&amp;rsquo;s greater might began to&#xA;prevail and Sugriva was in such obvious&#xA;distress that Rama who was watching with&#xA;ready bow knew he could not hold out&#xA;much longer.&#xA;It was now or never and placing a&#xA;deadly arrow on the string and pulling it&#xA;to his ear, Rama sped it at Vali&amp;rsquo;s mighty&#xA;chest. Pierced by that irresistible shaft&#xA;Vali crashed down as falls a great forest&#xA;tree cut asunder by the woodman&amp;rsquo;s axe&#xA;and lay stretched on the ground&#xA;empurpled with blood as lies the festival&#xA;flag-staff pulled down when the festival is&#xA;ended.Even so, he was radiantly handsome,&#xA;his noble figure shining like a cloud lit up&#xA;by the setting sun. The divine necklace&#xA;given to him by Indra shone on his breast,&#xA;which guarded his life and fortune. This&#xA;jewel, Rama&amp;rsquo;s dart, the bleeding wound,&#xA;all added lustre to his mighty body.&#xA;Valmiki&#xA;describes&#xA;beautifully&#xA;the&#xA;majestic appearance of the fallen hero. A&#xA;true warrior is never so beautiful as when&#xA;he lies dying on the field of battle.&#xA;Astounded at being hit and laid low,&#xA;when he least expected it from an&#xA;unknown quarter, Vali looked round in&#xA;perplexed surprise and saw Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana approaching him bow in hand.&#xA;With tears of indignant wrath, and in a&#xA;voice faint with approaching dissolution,&#xA;he accused them of ignoble perfidy in&#xA;dealing causeless death to a person&#xA;engaged in combat with another.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rama,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;you are the son of&#xA;Emperor Dasaratha. Born of a noble race&#xA;and famous by your own exploits, how&#xA;did you bring yourself to do this deed?&#xA;The world is full of praises for your valor&#xA;and virtue. And yet, while I was absorbed&#xA;in a battle with another, you came unseen,&#xA;and from behind, shot a fatal arrow at me.&#xA;How false and undeserved is your&#xA;reputation for manly virtue, for truth and&#xA;forbearance! What will the world think of&#xA;you now? What harm have I ever done to&#xA;you? Did I come out to fight with you?&#xA;You have killed me like an assassin&#xA;concealing yourself behind the trees. For a&#xA;royal prince to kill an innocent person in&#xA;this way is grievous sin. You are&#xA;unworthy for kingship. The goddess Earth&#xA;will never consent to take you for a&#xA;bridegroom. My greatest sorrow is that I&#xA;am killed by a base and sinful wretch. If it&#xA;was battle with me you wanted, I would&#xA;have given it to you, and slain by me in&#xA;fair combat you might have been lying in&#xA;the dust as I do now. Or if it was help to&#xA;recover your Sita I would have won her&#xA;back for you in a day. I would have killed&#xA;Ravana and dragged his body with a rope&#xA;round the neck and placed it at your feet.&#xA;No matter where he has hidden Sita, I&#xA;would have discovered her and restored&#xA;her to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Vali, son of Indra, reproached&#xA;Rama with his dying breath. And all this&#xA;is fully set out by Valmiki, the divine&#xA;poet, as well as by Kamban. Against this&#xA;accusation what defence could Rama&#xA;offer? Valmiki has it that Rama gave&#xA;some explanation with which Vali was&#xA;satisfied. But I am omitting all this as&#xA;pointless and pray that the learned may&#xA;forgive me.&#xA;What I think is that an avatar is an&#xA;avatar and that among the sorrows that the&#xA;Lord and His consort had to endure in&#xA;their earthly incarnation, this liability to&#xA;have their actions weighed on the earthly&#xA;scales is a part. Vali bruised and bleeding&#xA;from the many wounds of his fight with&#xA;Sugriva, lay in the throes of death.&#xA;He lived just long enough to see his&#xA;queen and his beloved son Angada. The&#xA;poor bewildered lad who at his mother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;bidding &amp;rsquo;to fall at the feet of his father who&#xA;was going on a long long journey&#39;&#xA;prostrated himself in silence, too stunned&#xA;to realise the extent of his loss. This will&#xA;be narrated later. Vali&amp;rsquo;s words were&#xA;addressed to Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;All is over, I shall blame you no more.&#xA;My dear, dear son Angada is orphaned.&#xA;You and Sugriva should look after him. I&#xA;entrust him to you. Look after him it is&#xA;your duty to see that he does not pine&#xA;away like a withering lotus-plant in a&#xA;dried-up tank. Tell Sugriva that he should&#xA;not imagine that it was Tara who set me&#xA;up against him. Ask him to treat Angada&#xA;as he should treat a prince, with honor and&#xA;affection. Do this for me. I want no more.&#xA;The warrior&amp;rsquo;s Heaven is calling me!&amp;ldquo;So ended Vali&amp;rsquo;s life.&#xA;Owing to the protective virtue of&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s necklace, Rama could not have&#xA;met Vali face to face and vanquished him,&#xA;just as Ravana could not be conquered by&#xA;the gods. Rama could kill Vali only when&#xA;himself unseen. And still the question&#xA;stands, why should Vali have been killed&#xA;at all?&#xA;Perhaps the answer is to be found in&#xA;what Kabandha said to Rama in gratitude&#xA;for being released from his curse.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Through Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s friendship you will&#xA;recover Sita,&amp;rdquo; Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s help not Vali&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;And so Rama went in search of Sugriva,&#xA;found him and pledged his friendship and&#xA;consecrated it by fire. Sugriva had&#xA;committed&#xA;no&#xA;unforgivable&#xA;offence&#xA;against Vali. Yet Vali, with his&#xA;supernatural strength, persecuted his&#xA;brother.&#xA;Hearing the latter&amp;rsquo;s complaint, Rama&#xA;had pledged his word to kill Vali and&#xA;restore to Sugriva his wife and make him&#xA;king as his part of the contract of alliance.&#xA;Thereafter, Rama had no alternative. To&#xA;kill Vali from cover became an inevitable&#xA;necessity. Rama erred in running after the&#xA;magic deer to please his wife.&#xA;Consequent on this, difficulties and&#xA;sorrows and conflicts of duty pursued&#xA;him. If we keep in mind that when God&#xA;takes a lower and limited form by His&#xA;own ordinance, limitations follow and we&#xA;should not be confused thereby. This is&#xA;my humble view as against other&#xA;explanations propounded by the pious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>44 TARA&#39;S GRIEF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THERE was panic in Kishkindha when&#xA;the news came that Vali had been slain by&#xA;an archer, and the Vanaras fled hither and&#xA;thither in hopeless confusion. Tara, seeing&#xA;this, laid aside her own grief and like a&#xA;queen put courage in her husband&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;subjects saying: &amp;ldquo;Till this day you walked&#xA;before the King to battle! Why, then do&#xA;you flee in fear now? There is no danger&#xA;for you. Rama killed Vali only to make&#xA;Sugriva king. Your lives are in no danger;&#xA;you will only have a different ruler; that is&#xA;all. You need not fly or fear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When she tried to go to the spot where&#xA;her husband lay dead, the Vanaras stopped&#xA;her saying: &amp;ldquo;We shall crown Angada king&#xA;and we shall make safe the fortress. We&#xA;shall defend the town against Sugriva and&#xA;his allies.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But she said: &amp;ldquo;Now my noble lord is&#xA;dead, nothing matters.&amp;rdquo; And boldly she&#xA;went straight to where Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana were standing.&#xA;When she saw her husband lying&#xA;wounded to death she could not control&#xA;her sorrow. She sobbed and cried.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ah my hero!&amp;rdquo; she wept embracing the&#xA;wounded Vali. &amp;ldquo;How many heroes have&#xA;you laid low and now you lie low&#xA;yourself! And you have left me here!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Soon Vali&amp;rsquo;s son Angada reached the&#xA;spot. And Sugriva, witnessing this scene,&#xA;was filled with remorse at the thought that&#xA;it was all for him that this calamity had&#xA;happened. The remorse was no doubt&#xA;genuine.&#xA;For&#xA;invariably&#xA;revenge,&#xA;especially revenge wreaked on those who&#xA;have been friends in other day; brings&#xA;nothing but bitterness and grief, and the&#xA;momentary feeling of triumph is all ashes&#xA;to the taste. How few of us realise this in&#xA;the confusion created by desires and&#xA;anger!&#xA;Tara rolled on the ground and&#xA;lamented: &amp;ldquo;Leaving dear Angada an&#xA;orphan and myself a helpless destitute you&#xA;have gone on the journey from which&#xA;there is no return. My Lord! My hero! &amp;quot;&#xA;Hanuman tried to console her: &amp;ldquo;The&#xA;dead reach their places in heaven. Why&#xA;lament for Vali? Angada will be crowned&#xA;in due course and we shall then rejoice. It&#xA;is our duty to look after Angada. Let usnow&#xA;think&#xA;of&#xA;performing&#xA;Vali&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;obsequies.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I care for nothing,&amp;rdquo; answered Tara. &amp;ldquo;It&#xA;is for Sugriva to perform the obsequies&#xA;and to look after Angada. What is there&#xA;for me to do? Can a thousand Angadas&#xA;equal in my eyes my husband? With him I&#xA;shall enter the house of Yama. That alone&#xA;will please me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vali, unconscious till now, opened his&#xA;eyes for the last time and addressing&#xA;Sugriva said: &amp;ldquo;Brother, we two could have&#xA;been friends and reigned happily over the&#xA;kingdom. But it was not given to us to be&#xA;so wise and happy. I am more to blame&#xA;than you, but why talk about that now?&#xA;Hereafter you shall rule the kingdom. I&#xA;have entrusted to you Angada, my son,&#xA;dearer than life itself to Tara and me. He&#xA;is a warrior equal to you in prowess. Be a&#xA;father to him and look after him with&#xA;kindness. This is my only request to you.&#xA;And be kind to Tara who was not only a&#xA;blameless and affectionate wife, but also a&#xA;very wise and far-sighted counsellor.&#xA;Whatever she foretells is bound to happen.&#xA;Do not disregard her advice on any&#xA;matter. Here, take the necklace that Indra&#xA;gave me and take with it its secret power.&#xA;My life is over and so is my resentment.&#xA;May you be happy!&amp;rdquo; Thus the generous&#xA;Vali blessed his brother Sugriva.&#xA;He gave good advice to Angada:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sugriva is now your king. Be loyal to&#xA;him and give him patient, affectionate&#xA;service.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Like a flowering creeper embracing a&#xA;forest tree felled down by an axe, Tara lay&#xA;on the ground clinging to Vali.&#xA;Nila, as gently as he could, drew out&#xA;the dart from Vali&amp;rsquo;s chest.&#xA;Blood gushed out of the wound and&#xA;spread into a pool. Vali&amp;rsquo;s life left his body.&#xA;Tara lamented loudly. &amp;ldquo;For the last time&#xA;salute your father,&amp;rdquo; she bade Angada in&#xA;heart-broken accents. &amp;ldquo;O my husband!&#xA;Your dear son is bowing before you. Will&#xA;you not say a word to him? Alas! I am a&#xA;widow and he is an orphan.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sight of all this struck Sugriva to&#xA;the heart. He said to himself: &amp;ldquo;Moved by&#xA;desire I closed the entrance of the cave&#xA;and leaving Vali there, I seized and&#xA;enjoyed his wealth. What a sinner have I&#xA;been!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It may be that in his penitent mood&#xA;Sugriva accused himself wrongly, but it is&#xA;also true that, without our knowledge,&#xA;desire corrupts our mind and leads us to&#xA;wrong actions and entangles us in sin.&#xA;Sugriva felt that desire had unknowingly&#xA;blinded and betrayed him.&#xA;Kama in Sanskrit stands for lust and&#xA;greed and every kind of desire. Kama is&#xA;man&amp;rsquo;s internal foe which he has to&#xA;vanquish. This is the lesson taught in the&#xA;last seven slokas of the third chapter of&#xA;the Gita. Sri Krishna concludes his&#xA;exhortation with these words: &amp;ldquo;Jahi&#xA;Satrum Kamaroopam Durasadam.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;If desire corrupted Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s mind,&#xA;anger corrupted Vali&amp;rsquo;s. When Vali saw&#xA;that Sugriva had barred the entrance and&#xA;left him shut up in the cave he felt&#xA;convinced that Sugriva had accompanied&#xA;him in his pursuit of the Rakshasa not as a&#xA;brother but with a treacherous motive. He&#xA;concluded that Sugriva had planned to&#xA;sacrifice him to the Asura and usurp his&#xA;place.&#xA;He became a prey to his own fury. He&#xA;disgraced and drove out his blood brother&#xA;and nursed his anger. Anger (krodha, as it&#xA;is called in Sanskrit) betrayed Vali into&#xA;sin.&#xA;Indeed kama and krodha are the&#xA;ultimate causes of all sin. Unless we&#xA;defend our heart against these foes and&#xA;keep them out, we cannot escape sin.&#xA;Sugriva lamented: &amp;ldquo;Though my sin was&#xA;great, he would not kill me. He drove me&#xA;out and allowed me to escape with life.That was all. But I conspired to slay him&#xA;and succeeded. There is no sinner like me&#xA;in the world and yet with his last breath he&#xA;gave me the kingdom to rule and gave,&#xA;too, the gift of Indra, the necklace of&#xA;power. Indeed he was noble. Why should&#xA;I still cling to this base life, I, who brought&#xA;about the death of my heroic brother?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At least once a year, men that follow&#xA;ancient&#xA;custom&#xA;utter&#xA;the&#xA;prayer&#xA;Kamokarsheet manyurakarsheet. That is:&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Desire lured me into sin, anger lured me&#xA;into sin.&amp;rsquo; So saying many times with&#xA;humble penitence, they seek to cleanse&#xA;their hearts. This is a practice that all&#xA;should follow, to repent and purify the&#xA;heart and surrender it to the Lord,&#xA;Kamokarsheet&#xA;manyurakarsheet,&#xA;Narayanaya namah.&#xA;With fear and hesitation, Rama gently&#xA;approached the weeping Tara. But there&#xA;was no sign of anger on her face. The&#xA;words she addressed to the slayer of her&#xA;husband were worthy of a hero&amp;rsquo;s queen.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;With the weapon with which, O Warrior,&#xA;you killed my husband, kill me too and&#xA;enable me to join him. Even in heaven, he&#xA;will not be happy without me. Do not fear&#xA;it would be a sin. It will be a meritorious&#xA;act to unite husband and wife. This will&#xA;cleanse your sin, your treacherous slaying&#xA;of my husband.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Valmiki says at this stage that Tara&#xA;knew the truth of Rama&amp;rsquo;s incarnation and&#xA;saw Vishnu in him. The traditional belief&#xA;is that, like Sumitra, the mother of&#xA;Lakshmana, Tara, the wife of Vali, was a&#xA;jnani, a knower of Reality. Though at first&#xA;she hated Rama for his treachery, yet&#xA;when she saw him face to face she saw his&#xA;divinity, so it is said.&#xA;Those who read the Ramayana as a&#xA;mere tale would find all this pointless. But&#xA;to the followers of bhakti marga, this will&#xA;not sound improbable. Tulasidas sings at&#xA;this point that Siva explains to Parvati:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look, Uma, how Rama, the Supreme&#xA;Being, moves all creatures like puppets&#xA;tied to strings!&amp;rdquo; Bhakti is needed to realise&#xA;the full meaning of Hindu ancient&#xA;mythology.&#xA;Even on a rational basis, Tara comes&#xA;out as a diplomat, an expert in&#xA;statesmanship. She had the intelligence to&#xA;anticipate coming events. What had&#xA;happened had happened. By his address&#xA;and good fortune, Sugriva had secured the&#xA;alliance of Rama. Vali was no more;&#xA;Angada&amp;rsquo;s welfare was all that she should&#xA;care for hereafter.&#xA;Could Angada afford to antagonise&#xA;Sugriva with Rama and Lakshmana ready&#xA;to support him bow in hand? Peace, not&#xA;war was indicated.&#xA;Hence, when she concealed her anger&#xA;from Rama and put on an appearance of&#xA;patient submission to events, she was&#xA;really securing the best interests of&#xA;Angada and winning for him the&#xA;compassion and sympathy of all.&#xA;Vali&amp;rsquo;s obsequies were performed with&#xA;due form and ceremony. After the&#xA;auspicious bath, Sugriva was crowned&#xA;king and Angada was made Yuvaraja.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE rainy season began. Sugriva and&#xA;his companions spent the time in&#xA;Kishkindha in enjoyment but Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana spent the weary days waiting&#xA;in a cave nearby. The forest paths were&#xA;flooded and became rushing torrents,&#xA;impossible to traverse. The search for&#xA;Sita, therefore, had to be suspended. Rama&#xA;brooded over Sita&amp;rsquo;s predicament and was&#xA;plunged in sorrow. Lakshmana counselled&#xA;him to bear with the delay till the rainy&#xA;season ended. And Rama held his soul in&#xA;patience.&#xA;The edge of the keenest sorrow wears&#xA;with time and perhaps Heaven&amp;rsquo;s kindest&#xA;gifts to men are sleep for the fleeting caresof the day and forgetfulness for the deep-&#xA;seated injuries of the heart. Kishkindha&#xA;mourned her Vali for a time, and then&#xA;rejoiced in Sugriva and the survivors.&#xA;Sugriva forgot the privations of his exile&#xA;and the remorse for his brother&amp;rsquo;s death. He&#xA;enjoyed to the full his present prosperity&#xA;and even Tara reconciled and adapted&#xA;herself to altered circumstances in the&#xA;interests of her son.&#xA;The royal palace of Kishkindha was&#xA;full of joy and drinking, and the gloomy&#xA;months of rain, which the Raghu brothers&#xA;spent in leaden repining, sped with&#xA;golden-winged enjoyment for Sugriva and&#xA;his household. Only Hanuman felt&#xA;anxious. He could not forget Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;business. He was looking out for an&#xA;opportunity to remind the king of his&#xA;pledge to Rama.&#xA;At last, the rains ceased and the sky&#xA;was cleared of cloud and lightning. The&#xA;air was sweet with the perfumes of&#xA;flowers and the songs of birds and joy&#xA;came to life in the forest again. The&#xA;intelligent and high virtuous Hanuman&#xA;now approached his king. Sugriva had&#xA;entrusted all official duties to the&#xA;ministers and was absorbed in pleasure.&#xA;Hanuman knew that the wisest and best of&#xA;men neglect their promises in such&#xA;circumstances and addressed the king with&#xA;great politeness:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have regained the kingdom of&#xA;your ancestors and are in secure&#xA;possession and enjoyment of it. But&#xA;something yet remains to be done. You&#xA;must fulfil your promise to your allies and&#xA;so increase your fame and strengthen your&#xA;power. Even at the sacrifice of one&amp;rsquo;s own&#xA;interests and pleasure, one should carry&#xA;out the business of one&amp;rsquo;s friends according&#xA;to one&amp;rsquo;s promise. Only so can a king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;authority and reputation grow. It will be&#xA;best to fulfil one&amp;rsquo;s promise before the due&#xA;date. In any case delay should be avoided.&#xA;Fulfilment after the promised date is&#xA;worse than useless. One should not wait to&#xA;be reminded by one&amp;rsquo;s friends of what had&#xA;been promised to them. All this you know&#xA;without my telling you. Remembering&#xA;what Rama had done for us. We must take&#xA;steps to fulfil our promise without waiting&#xA;to be reminded by him. The rainy season&#xA;is over. There is no ground for further&#xA;delay. We can no longer postpone the task&#xA;of searching for Sita. Rama may be very&#xA;patient, but that does not justify any&#xA;further delay on our part. Did not Rama&#xA;kill your foe promptly, not minding the&#xA;danger or the blame involved? We should&#xA;fulfil our promise with equal promptness.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus politely did Maruti convey his&#xA;advice to Sugriva. The latter accepted it&#xA;and, thanking Hanuman, ordered Nila to&#xA;mobilise the Vanara army. &amp;ldquo;All the world&#xA;must be searched and Sita found,&amp;rdquo; he said.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Order therefore the most powerful&#xA;Vanaras to come and join up at once.&#xA;Those who fail will be summarily&#xA;punished.&amp;rdquo; Having said this, Sugriva went&#xA;back into private apartments.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana spent the time in&#xA;their cave waiting for the end of the rainy&#xA;season and the fulfilment by Sugriva of&#xA;his promise. But when the rains were over&#xA;and the forest and its creatures shone with&#xA;renewed beauty, Rama grieved intensely&#xA;at the thought of Sita suffering at the&#xA;hands of the Rakshasas.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The world is full of life and joy,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Rama. &amp;ldquo;But Sita is in agony somewhere.&#xA;And I sit still here, awaiting the favor of&#xA;this ungrateful Vanara king. Alas, she&#xA;walked cheerfully through the Dandaka&#xA;forest, as if it were a palace-park. She did&#xA;not mind the stony ground and the thorns&#xA;in the path. What must be her suffering&#xA;now? But this king, drowned in his cups&#xA;and revelling in the company of his&#xA;women, has forgotten his promise to me.&#xA;Lakshmana! Go at once to Kishkindhaand tell this base king: &amp;lsquo;Remember! Know&#xA;that the path still yawns open whereby the&#xA;slaughtered Vali went to his doom. Do not&#xA;follow him, but fulfil your promise to me.&#xA;Ruin awaits him who forgets kindness&#xA;and, neglects friends. Beware of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrows. The four months of the rainy&#xA;season are over. These four months were&#xA;like four ages to Rama, but to you,&#xA;steeped in pleasures, they have perhaps&#xA;sped like minutes! By delay you incur&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s wrath and seek your destruction.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Go, Lakshmana, and tell him this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This was the angry and impatient&#xA;message Rama wanted Lakshmana to take&#xA;to Sugriva.&#xA;Carrying this weight of his brother&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;grief and anger, Lakshmana was about to&#xA;leave. Then Rama thought again. He knew&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s nature and feared danger&#xA;from his rashness. So he called him back&#xA;and said to him: &amp;ldquo;In conveying my&#xA;complaint to Sugriva, do not be harsh.&#xA;Whatever his faults, he is our friend. Point&#xA;out his faults to him, but say nothing&#xA;harsh.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana agreed, but he found it&#xA;hard to control his own anger as he&#xA;approached the gates of Kishkindha.&#xA;Noting the severe face of Lakshmana&#xA;who was fully armed, the Vanara sentry&#xA;became alert and made ready to guard the&#xA;fortress. This enraged Lakshmana still&#xA;further.&#xA;Some Vanaras ran to the inner&#xA;apartments and reported to Sugriva:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, furious with anger, is&#xA;coming here bow in hand. We could not&#xA;stop him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But the Vanara king was tipsy and&#xA;surrounded by women and he took no&#xA;notice. The king&amp;rsquo;s servants ordered the&#xA;sentry at the gates to stand firm and&#xA;prevent the entry of any one. Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;anger&#xA;became&#xA;quite&#xA;uncontrollable.&#xA;Lakshmana forced his way in. There he&#xA;met young Angada, the thought of whose&#xA;youth and misfortunes took away&#xA;something of the edge of his wrath. &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;child go and tell the Vanara king,&amp;rdquo; he said,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;that Lakshmana is waiting at the palace&#xA;gate to have audience of him on behalf of&#xA;his grief stricken brother.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Angada went accordingly to the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;apartment&#xA;and&#xA;informed&#xA;him&#xA;of&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s visit. But Sugriva was in no&#xA;condition to understand. Angada saw this&#xA;and took counsel with the ministers as to&#xA;what should be done. Hanuman and some&#xA;of the fellow ministers gently explained&#xA;what was happening and Sugriva was at&#xA;last roused from his tipsy condition.&#xA;Sugriva said: &amp;ldquo;I am not at fault, am I?&#xA;Why should my friends Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana be angry with me? Some&#xA;enemy must have carried tales and set&#xA;them up against me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman answered: &amp;ldquo;It is my duty, O&#xA;king, to say these things and I say them.&#xA;Do not be angry with me. We have&#xA;delayed in carrying out our promise to&#xA;Rama. We have forgotten Rama&amp;rsquo;s grief. It&#xA;is late, but not too late. Hence let us do&#xA;quickly what we should. Let us seek&#xA;forgiveness from Lakshmana. Let us,&#xA;without further delay, take steps to fulfil&#xA;our promise to Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Sugriva agreed to receive&#xA;Lakshmana.&#xA;As Lakshmana went into the Vanara&#xA;town, he marvelled at its beauty and the&#xA;culture of Kishkindha. Passing through&#xA;beautiful streets, he stood outside the&#xA;king&amp;rsquo;s palace. Hearing the sounds of&#xA;revelry, of dance and song, proceeding&#xA;from within, he saw that the Vanaras had&#xA;forgotten their promise and were lost in&#xA;enjoyment. He could hardly control his&#xA;anger. Still he held back from entering the&#xA;women&amp;rsquo;s chamber and, standing in a&#xA;corner, outside, he twanged his bowstring.The sound filled all Kishkindha with&#xA;fear and trembling. Sugriva, hearing it,&#xA;realised that the prince was, indeed, angry.&#xA;He saw the danger and asked Tara to go&#xA;and pacify the prince. &amp;ldquo;A chivalrous man&#xA;like Lakshmana will find his anger slip&#xA;from him, when he speaks to a lady and it&#xA;will be impossible for him to continue&#xA;wrathful.&amp;rdquo; said the king, shrewd even in&#xA;his tipsy condition.&#xA;Tara advanced towards Lakshmana. In&#xA;looks, in knowledge of the world and skill&#xA;in speech, Tara was unrivalled She said to&#xA;Lakshmana: &amp;ldquo;After enduring for a long&#xA;time poverty and persecution, Sugriva is&#xA;enjoying the pleasures and the prosperity&#xA;you have secured for him. This enjoyment&#xA;has gone to his head and he has lost his&#xA;senses. I know his fault, but you should&#xA;forgive him. The high souled that knows&#xA;the foibles and imperfections of our&#xA;common nature should temper their&#xA;censure with compassion. So be not too&#xA;harsh in judging of King Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;surrender to temptations of the flesh,&#xA;especially after his long trials and&#xA;privations. But I can assure you, he has&#xA;never lost sight of his debt or his duty to&#xA;you. He has already issued orders for&#xA;mobilising the Vanara warriors from all&#xA;quarters. Today or tomorrow they will all&#xA;be here. Then the search for Sita and the&#xA;war against Ravana will begin. Have no&#xA;doubts. And now, pray come in and see&#xA;the King.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana, now no longer angry,&#xA;entered&#xA;the&#xA;apartment.&#xA;Sugriva,&#xA;descending from his seat, welcomed&#xA;Lakshmana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Forgive my faults,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;With&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s friendship and help I am King&#xA;today. How can I ever forget what I owe&#xA;to the valorous and good Rama? He can&#xA;destroy his foes without any help from&#xA;me. I, with my armies, can only follow&#xA;him. That is all. Surely Ravana will&#xA;perish. The search for Sita will soon&#xA;begin. Do forgive the delay of which I am&#xA;guilty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana was pleased. &amp;ldquo;Rama is&#xA;your equal in honor and prowess, none&#xA;else,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Come with me to&#xA;Rishyamuka and give him words of&#xA;comfort in his grief.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva and Lakshmana went in a litter&#xA;to Rama and, explaining the arrangements&#xA;already made, satisfied him.&#xA;Rama was pleased. He said: &amp;ldquo;You&#xA;indeed are a real friend. Like the clouds&#xA;yielding rain, the sun destroying darkness&#xA;and the moon pleasing human hearts, a&#xA;good friend comes to one&amp;rsquo;s help&#xA;spontaneously. I am happy in your&#xA;friendship. Now the end of Ravana and&#xA;his race is certain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even as Rama was expressing his&#xA;gratitude and joy, great multitudes of&#xA;Vanaras under their respective leaders&#xA;arrived and assembled. They came from&#xA;distant forests, mountains and coasts. The&#xA;dust they raised darkened the sky.&#xA;Millions of monkeys and bears in a&#xA;variety of shapes and colors were there.&#xA;Sugriva addressed this enormous army&#xA;and showed them their appointed camping&#xA;places. Later, he divided the host into&#xA;eight divisions and sent each under its&#xA;commander, thoroughly to search in the&#xA;eight directions for Sita.&#xA;One point is worth noting here. The&#xA;Tamil poet Kamban describes Tara as a&#xA;chaste widow living a life of discipline&#xA;and privations. It is different in Valmiki,&#xA;who includes Tara and the other women&#xA;as part of the inheritance Sugriva won&#xA;from Vali, in fact, as an appendage of the&#xA;throne. When Sugriva lost himself in&#xA;bodily pleasures and forgot his duty to&#xA;Rama, Tara shared his revels and is&#xA;described as being flushed and unsteady&#xA;with wine when she went out at her lord&amp;rsquo;scommand&#xA;to&#xA;allay&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;resentment.&#xA;In ancient times, when an elder brother&#xA;died leaving a wife, there was a custom in&#xA;royal and other noble families for the&#xA;younger brother to take the widow as wife&#xA;and protect her. It is difficult for people of&#xA;one age to judge the customs of another&#xA;age. Imagination and great flexibility of&#xA;mind are needed to assess the merits and&#xA;defects of usage&amp;rsquo;s with which we are not&#xA;familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;LOOK, Rama, at this Vanara army,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Sugriva. &amp;ldquo;All these myriads, of&#xA;wondrous strength, are yours to command.&#xA;They are willing and able to do you all the&#xA;service you demand. Consider this huge&#xA;army as your own and bid them to do&#xA;whatever you wish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama, beside himself with joy;&#xA;embraced Sugriva. He said: &amp;ldquo;First we&#xA;should find out whether Sita is alive, and&#xA;if so where she is. Next we should know&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts. Then we shall do&#xA;what needs to be done. But it is for you,&#xA;not for me or Lakshmana, to command&#xA;this army. You are their King. Besides,&#xA;you know best what needs to be done and&#xA;how to do it. Blessed am I to have a friend&#xA;like you and a brother like Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Sugriva issued stringent orders to&#xA;his commanders at once to send divisions&#xA;of the army to the four quarters of the&#xA;earth to make a thorough search for Sita.&#xA;After sending away the other leaders,&#xA;Sugriva took Hanuman aside and told&#xA;him: &amp;ldquo;Son of Vayu, possessing the&#xA;strength and splendor of your father, you&#xA;alone can succeed in this task. You have&#xA;strength, courage and intelligence and on&#xA;you I rely to take up and discharge this&#xA;responsibility of discovering Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama too felt that Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s efforts&#xA;would be crowned with success. Whatever&#xA;obstacles turned up, he felt that Hanuman&#xA;would find a way of overcoming them. He&#xA;gave his signet ring to Hanuman and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Take this ring. I am full of hope that you&#xA;will discover Sita. This ring will tell her&#xA;that you are my messenger. Dear&#xA;Hanuman, may you bring Sita and me&#xA;together again!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Readers should realise the solemnity&#xA;and pathos of the scene. Rama full of&#xA;abiding trust in the devoted loyalty and&#xA;valor of Hanuman placed the ring as&#xA;though it was his own hungry heart in his&#xA;servant&amp;rsquo;s hand. The ideal servant accepted&#xA;the sacred trust with a deep reverence and&#xA;an unshakable resolve never to fail his&#xA;master.&#xA;Sugriva gave orders to his army. &amp;ldquo;Sita&#xA;must anyhow be discovered. No matter&#xA;where she is hidden, you can and must&#xA;find her. Within a month you must return&#xA;with news of her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And the army swarmed out like ants&#xA;from an anthill and spread in the four&#xA;directions.&#xA;Satabali and his army proceeded&#xA;northwards. Vinata went east, Sushena&#xA;westwards,&#xA;Hanuman,&#xA;Angada&#xA;and&#xA;General Tara travelled southwards.&#xA;All were equally enthusiastic and&#xA;equally eager to catch and kill Ravana and&#xA;redeem Sita. Each group was anxious to&#xA;be first to return with success. There was&#xA;tumultuous rivalry.&#xA;Rama enquired of Sugriva: &amp;ldquo;You&#xA;describe every quarter and region of the&#xA;earth like one who has seen the whole&#xA;world with his own eyes. How and when&#xA;did you see it all?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You will remember, my Lord,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Sugriva, &amp;ldquo;how Vali pursued me in all&#xA;directions. Wherever I went, he still&#xA;pursued me. And so I had to wander over&#xA;the face of the whole world. I thus had&#xA;occasion to see every part of this planet.&#xA;Later, I learnt about the spot where Rishi&#xA;Matanga had built his ashrama. If Valientered that region, his head would go to&#xA;pieces by the sage&amp;rsquo;s curse. I knew that he&#xA;would not come to that place and could&#xA;not harm me even if he came. So there I&#xA;lay protected.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The hordes that went north, east and&#xA;west returned in a month and reported that&#xA;Sita was not to be found anywhere.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Carefully&#xA;we&#xA;searched&#xA;forests,&#xA;mountains, rivers and cities, but nowhere&#xA;could we find her. Hanuman, who had&#xA;gone southwards, is the lucky one. Did not&#xA;the Rakshasa carrying Sita also travel&#xA;southwards? And Hanuman has not yet&#xA;returned.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama, hearing this, was satisfied that&#xA;the Vanaras had done their best.&#xA;Hanuman and Angada entered and&#xA;searched the caves and forests of the&#xA;Vindhyas. Then they came upon a desert,&#xA;where a rishi was performing tapas. By&#xA;his curse it was devoid of trees and plants,&#xA;of birds and beasts. Travelling further&#xA;south, they saw a big Asura. The cruel&#xA;one, regarding the Vanara crowd as a&#xA;good meal sprang up to catch them. They&#xA;thought at first that this was no other than&#xA;Ravana.&#xA;Angada rushed towards him and gave&#xA;him a mighty blow. Unable to stand it, the&#xA;Asura spat blood and fell on the earth and&#xA;lay dead like a great hill. Rejoicing in the&#xA;thought that Ravana was dead, the&#xA;Vanaras searched the forest for Sita. But,&#xA;there was no sign of her. And so they&#xA;carried the search elsewhere.&#xA;Often they would weary of their&#xA;fruitless search and sit down in blank&#xA;despair.&#xA;At&#xA;such&#xA;times,&#xA;Angada,&#xA;Gandhamadana or some other leader&#xA;would encourage them and make them&#xA;resume the search. Many days were spent&#xA;in this way. Yet Sita was not to be seen&#xA;and they dreaded Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s displeasure.&#xA;Very far they travelled southwards in&#xA;their search.&#xA;Passing through a desert, fainting with&#xA;hunger and thirst, they saw a cave from&#xA;which issued a variety of birds full of the&#xA;joy of life. The gentle breeze which came&#xA;out of it covered them with the pollen of&#xA;lotus flowers and filled them with&#xA;fragrance.&#xA;The&#xA;Vanaras&#xA;concluded:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;undoubtedly there was water where the&#xA;birds and perfume came from.&amp;rdquo; And the&#xA;Vanaras forming a chain with linked&#xA;hands plunged cautiously into the dense&#xA;darkness of the cave with hearts full of&#xA;hope, though too parched with thirst even&#xA;to shout.&#xA;At long last, all of a sudden, light&#xA;appeared and they saw a lovely grove with&#xA;streams of pellucid water and trees&#xA;bowing under their wealth of fruit. Then&#xA;they came to a city, with streets paved&#xA;with jewels set in gold and great palaces&#xA;beautiful as a dream. They went along and&#xA;then they saw an aged tapasvini clad in&#xA;the garments of a recluse and seated on a&#xA;dark skin. The Vanaras trembled before&#xA;the divine splendor of her face.&#xA;Hanuman took courage to approach&#xA;her. Bowing low before her, he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Salutations to you, Mother. May we&#xA;know who you are? Thirsty and tired, we&#xA;entered the dark cave hoping for some&#xA;water. And now that we see this&#xA;unpeopled golden city with trees and&#xA;tanks, we are afraid, lest this be a vain&#xA;vision arising from the madness of too&#xA;great sufferings. Explain all this to us and&#xA;remove our fears.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She answered: &amp;ldquo;How did you find your&#xA;way into this cave? You will have plenty&#xA;of fruits and drink here. This palace was&#xA;built by Maya, the architect of the&#xA;Danavas. He learnt the art from&#xA;Sukracharya. Long and happily did Maya&#xA;live here, till he incurred the enmity of&#xA;Indra, who slew him. Later Indra gave this&#xA;golden palace to Hema, my friend. These&#xA;buildings and parks are hers. At presentshe has gone to the abode of the gods. But&#xA;what is your purpose in coming here?&#xA;Why did you weary yourselves wandering&#xA;in the forests? First eat, drink and refresh&#xA;yourselves and then tell me all about&#xA;yourselves.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They ate and drank and refreshed&#xA;themselves and were happy. Then&#xA;Hanuman explained to the ascetic the&#xA;purpose of their wandering.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rama, son of Emperor Dasaratha, for&#xA;some reason, left his kingdom and lived in&#xA;the forest with his brother and wife. Then&#xA;a Rakshasa carried off Sita, the wife of&#xA;Rama. The two went out searching for&#xA;her. They made the acquaintance of&#xA;Sugriva, the Vanara King, and became&#xA;friends with him. He has sent us on this&#xA;mission to search for Sita and find her for&#xA;Rama. Our King fixed a time limit for us&#xA;to return with a clue. We lost our way in&#xA;the darkness of this cave and the period is&#xA;now over. Now we do not know what to&#xA;do. Sugriva is a strict master. For failure&#xA;to do his bidding within the time set, he is&#xA;sure to visit us with the penalty of death.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Swayamprabha, that was the name of&#xA;the ascetic woman, said: &amp;ldquo;Alas! You&#xA;cannot by yourselves go out of this cave.&#xA;No stranger who enters it can go out of it&#xA;with life. But yours is a great mission and&#xA;I must, by my tapasya, transport you out.&#xA;Now shut your eyes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly they shut their eyes. All at&#xA;once they found themselves on the&#xA;seashore.&#xA;Reaching the seashore, they looked&#xA;round and they were start led to discover&#xA;that it was the beginning of spring.&#xA;Angada lamented: &amp;ldquo;Alas! The time set has&#xA;been transgressed. If we return to&#xA;Kishkindha without any clue about Sita,&#xA;the King will surely punish us with death.&#xA;He hates me. It was under pressure from&#xA;Rama that he agreed to make me&#xA;Yuvaraja, not because of love for me.&#xA;Instead of going there and losing our&#xA;lives, let us fast and seek death here and&#xA;now.&amp;rdquo; Many of his companions agreed&#xA;with Angada.&#xA;The Vanara General Tara said: &amp;ldquo;I do&#xA;not agree. Why should we end our lives?&#xA;Let us return to the cave of the tapasvini&#xA;Swamyamprabha and live there happily.&#xA;There is everything in plenty there.&#xA;Neither Sugriva nor anyone else can reach&#xA;this spot. We shall spend the rest of our&#xA;lives, free from care.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Hanuman said: &amp;ldquo;What unworthy&#xA;talk is this! What pleasure is there in&#xA;eating, drinking and sleeping in the cave,&#xA;leaving&#xA;our&#xA;families&#xA;in&#xA;faraway&#xA;Kishkindha? Sugriva is a good king whom&#xA;we need not fear. And if indeed Sugriva is&#xA;angry with us and determined to punish&#xA;us, how can this cave give us safety? Can&#xA;it stand against Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s rage? Will he&#xA;not smash it to pieces and kill us? I see no&#xA;benefit in Tara&amp;rsquo;s counsel. Let us return and&#xA;tell Sugriva the whole truth and beg for&#xA;his forgiveness. This is the only way to&#xA;safety.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I do not agree with Hanuman,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Angada. &amp;ldquo;Sugriva has no love or pity for&#xA;me. He is sure to kill me. He is of a cruel&#xA;nature. Remember how he killed my&#xA;father. He does not want me to live. He&#xA;will find some excuse or other for killing&#xA;me. He regards me as an obstacle in his&#xA;way and that of his progeny, who but for&#xA;me would inherit Kishkindha. To break a&#xA;promise is nothing to him. Did he not&#xA;forget his solemn pledge to Rama that he&#xA;would search for and recover Sita? Was it&#xA;not only for fear of Lakshmana and his&#xA;bow that he sent us on this search? My&#xA;poor bereaved mother has succumbed to&#xA;fear and accepted Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s protection.&#xA;She clings to life for my sake. Hearing&#xA;that I am dead, she will end her life. Alas!&#xA;I am miserable and know not what to do.&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;My death is certain&amp;rdquo;, he said again, &amp;ldquo;if&#xA;I return to Kishkindha. It is far better to&#xA;fast to death here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He spread on the ground the kusa grass&#xA;in the manner prescribed for the vow of&#xA;death, bowed to the gods and the dead and&#xA;sat facing east, determined to die.&#xA;When Angada the Yuvaraja took this&#xA;vow and sat in the posture of a fast unto&#xA;death, the other Vanaras cried in grief and,&#xA;resolving also to fast with him and die, sat&#xA;facing east.&#xA;From a neighboring hill, Sampati, the&#xA;vulture King, saw this crowd of Vanaras,&#xA;resigning themselves to fate. Having lost&#xA;his wings and being unable to move,&#xA;Sampati had been famishing for a long&#xA;time. He now rejoiced, saying to himself:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;So many monkeys are going to die here&#xA;together. I shall have enough food for a&#xA;long while without effort.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Meanwhile, the Vanaras, expecting&#xA;death, were recalling the past and talking&#xA;to one another and loudly lamenting over&#xA;all that had happened. &amp;ldquo;Because of&#xA;Kaikeyi, Dasaratha died,&amp;rdquo; they said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Because of Dasaratha, Rama had to dwell&#xA;in the forest. Ravana carried off Sita. The&#xA;heroic Jatayu lost his life in the attempt to&#xA;save Sita. If the heroic bird had strength&#xA;enough to continue the struggle a little&#xA;longer, Rama and Lakshmana would have&#xA;arrived on the spot and recovered Sita. By&#xA;fate did all these things happen and the&#xA;end of the tale is that we are dying here. In&#xA;what curious ways does fate work!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Listening&#xA;to&#xA;these&#xA;lamentations,&#xA;Sampati stared at the mention of Jatayu&#xA;who was his brother. Hearing him spoken&#xA;of as dead, he naturally wished to hear the&#xA;whole story.&#xA;Sampati was very old. He and Jatayu&#xA;were the children of Aruna, the god of&#xA;Dawn and brother of Garuda, Hari&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;vehicle. Jatayu and Sampati in their youth&#xA;competed with each other as to who could&#xA;fly higher and rose in the sky. As they&#xA;approached the sun the heat became&#xA;intolerable and Jatayu was about to be&#xA;burnt up.&#xA;But Sampati spread his wings and&#xA;protected his brother from the fury of the&#xA;sun. Jatayu was saved, but Sampati&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wings were burnt off. Unable to fly, he&#xA;fell down on a hill. Since then he could&#xA;not move but stayed in the same place&#xA;ever hungry for meal and just alive.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who brings sad news of my dear&#xA;brother Jatayu?&amp;rdquo; he cried in agony. &amp;ldquo;Oh,&#xA;Vanaras, is beloved Jatayu dead indeed?&#xA;Why did Rama son of King Dasaratha, go&#xA;to the forest? Why did he lose his wife?&#xA;Was Jatayu killed by Ravana? Tell me&#xA;all.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Vanaras had resolved to end their&#xA;lives. The wingless, old vulture had&#xA;desired to make an easy meal of them. But&#xA;now things turned out otherwise. The&#xA;Vanaras got up, went to Sampati and&#xA;gently led him down from the hill. Then&#xA;they talked and exchanged information.&#xA;Sampati recounted his story. Angada&#xA;related all that had happened in&#xA;Kishkindha and asked old Sampati how&#xA;Rama could be helped.&#xA;Sampati was old and weak, but his eyes&#xA;had not lost their keenness. He could see&#xA;things very far off. He could see Sita&#xA;captive in Lanka and described in detail&#xA;the wealth of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s kingdom. He saw&#xA;and described how Sita sat surrounded by&#xA;Rakshasis in Lanka. The Vanaras were&#xA;wild with joy. They jumped about saying,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Now we know all about Sita. There is no&#xA;need for us to die, Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose will be&#xA;achieved.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sampati&amp;rsquo;s troubles were also over. The&#xA;boon he had received that when he helped&#xA;Rama he would get back his wings came&#xA;true and even as they were talking, young&#xA;feathers began to spring and grow on his&#xA;sides. Sampati now shone with freshbeauty and he found satisfaction in&#xA;performing the funeral obsequies of&#xA;Jatayu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FROM Sampati the Vanaras learnt the&#xA;place where Sita was kept a prisoner in&#xA;the land of the Rakshasa, a hundred&#xA;yojanas across the ocean. But of course it&#xA;would not do to return to Sugriva at once&#xA;with this second-hand information. They&#xA;had outstayed the allotted time and only&#xA;outstanding success could save them from&#xA;punishment. They could not stop their&#xA;search till they saw with their own eyes&#xA;what Sampati had described only then&#xA;could they fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose.&#xA;But then they had to cross the sea.&#xA;They went to the edge of the water and&#xA;discussed matters. &amp;ldquo;How can we cross the&#xA;sea, enter Lanka, see Sita and return?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Anxiety and fear overwhelmed them.&#xA;Angada said: &amp;ldquo;No matter how hard the&#xA;task, one should never lose courage.&#xA;Courage is the key to success. To lose&#xA;heart is to lose everything.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then he asked each one of his&#xA;followers to state truly the maximum&#xA;length that he could jump.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh Vanara warriors!&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;much&#xA;have I heard from Sugriva of your&#xA;prowess. Your strength and your&#xA;enterprise are beyond dispute. We should&#xA;fulfil this task. We cannot return to&#xA;Kishkindha without seeing Sita. That is&#xA;certain. It is better for us to end our lives&#xA;here than to be slain in disgrace by the&#xA;king. Therefore, tell me, one by one, the&#xA;longest jump you have the strength and&#xA;courage to attempt.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Gaja said modestly: &amp;ldquo;I can jump ten&#xA;yojanas.&amp;rdquo; Gavaksha said: &amp;ldquo;I can do&#xA;twenty.&amp;rdquo; Another Vanara leader claimed&#xA;he could do thirty.&#xA;And so each improved on the figure of&#xA;the other. At last Jambavan, the oldest of&#xA;the warriors, spoke:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am now old and infirm. Yet I would&#xA;gladly spend myself to fulfil our king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;command. But what will mere devotion&#xA;avail if not seconded by strength? I think I&#xA;can manage ninety yojanas, but this is not&#xA;enough to cross the sea and reach Lanka. I&#xA;can only regret my lost youth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Yuvaraja himself said: &amp;ldquo;I can do a&#xA;hundred yojanas and reach Lanka, I have&#xA;no doubt. But I wonder whether I shall&#xA;have the strength for another jump of&#xA;equal length for the return journey.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jambavan answered, &amp;ldquo;O prince, you&#xA;need not doubt your strength. Your&#xA;prowess is as great as Vali&amp;rsquo;s. Yet it is not&#xA;proper for the crown prince to undertake&#xA;this task while there are others to do it&#xA;under&#xA;his&#xA;orders.&#xA;It&#xA;is&#xA;neither&#xA;statesmanlike nor safe for a king to act&#xA;directly.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Jambavan cast an appraising and&#xA;admiring look at Hanuman, who had sat&#xA;apart, listening to the talk, but saying&#xA;nothing.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I feel that the son of Vayu, sitting&#xA;there in silence is the one best fitted by&#xA;strength and skill to do this deed,&amp;rdquo; said the&#xA;old Vanara and walked up to Hanuman&#xA;and brought him to their midst.&#xA;Addressing Hanuman in the hearing of&#xA;the myriad&amp;rsquo;s of gloomy Vanaras,&#xA;Jambavan said: &amp;ldquo;O warrior, learned in all&#xA;branches of knowledge, why are you&#xA;sitting silent and apart? You are the equal&#xA;of King Sugriva, are you not? In strength&#xA;and splendor do you not surpass all the&#xA;rest of us? Why, are you not the equal of&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana themselves? I have&#xA;seen Garuda, the king of birds crossing&#xA;the sea. The might of your shoulders is not&#xA;less than that of Garuda&amp;rsquo;s wings. You are&#xA;not inferior to the son of Vinata in&#xA;strength or speed, but you are not aware of&#xA;your own prowess and intelligence. There&#xA;is no equal to you in the whole world.&#xA;Anjana, your mother, was a maidenamong the goddesses above. By the curse&#xA;of a rishi she was born as a Vanari. One&#xA;day, while she was wandering carefree on&#xA;a mountain slope, Vayu saw her beauty&#xA;and fell in love with her and embraced&#xA;her. She was wroth. &amp;lsquo;Who are you, O&#xA;wicked one&amp;rsquo; she asked, &amp;lsquo;who dares insult&#xA;me? The Wind-God answered: &amp;lsquo;Be not&#xA;angry, your body is not tainted by my&#xA;touch and loses not its virgin purity. Not&#xA;in body but in my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire did I&#xA;embrace you and out of this ethereal&#xA;embrace, a child will be born to you,&#xA;equal to me in strength and vigor. He will&#xA;be the mightiest and most intelligent&#xA;amongst the Vanaras.&amp;rsquo; Thus did the Wind-&#xA;God pacify Anjana. When you were a&#xA;little child, O Hanuman, you imagined the&#xA;rising sun to be a fruit and flew towards it&#xA;in order to pluck it. Seeing your effortless&#xA;and fearless flight Indra, king of the gods,&#xA;became concerned for the sun&amp;rsquo;s safety and&#xA;hurled his thunderbolt at you. Struck&#xA;down by it, you fell on a, mountain and&#xA;your right jaw was broken. Enraged by&#xA;this, your father the Wind-God stopped&#xA;his movements and stood still. All living&#xA;creatures became breathless and felt&#xA;strangled in the stillness. The gods begged&#xA;Vayu to lay aside his anger and showered&#xA;blessings on you. Brahma and Indra gave&#xA;you boons. No weapon can slay you.&#xA;Death can only come to you at your will&#xA;and not other wise. You are immortal.&#xA;Born of Anjana and begotten of the spirit&#xA;of the Wind-God, you are equal to him in&#xA;splendor, intelligence and power. But, for&#xA;all your strength, you are virtuous and&#xA;modest. You alone can help us to fulfil&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose. Crossing the sea is no&#xA;hard task to you. This great army of&#xA;Vanaras, struggling in a sea of distress,&#xA;you should rescue. You, who can cross the&#xA;sea, should not leave your power unused.&#xA;Increase your stature. You are the equal of&#xA;Garuda. Once I too was strong like you&#xA;and traversed the globe twenty-one times.&#xA;At the churning of the ocean of milk, I&#xA;fetched herbs from the four quarters at the&#xA;bidding of the gods. But now I am old and&#xA;weak. You are the sole hope of the&#xA;Vanaras. O, son of Anjana, we beg you,&#xA;noble one! With your heritage of divine&#xA;strength, delay no further. Realise your&#xA;true strength and spring forward. Like&#xA;Trivikrama, you can cross the sea at a&#xA;single jump. Do it and end our troubles.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The aged Jambavan thus praised&#xA;Hanuman, reminded him of his strength&#xA;and roused his dormant courage. At once&#xA;Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s form began to swell like the&#xA;sea in high tide. Even as the Vanaras were&#xA;watching him, the son of Vayu grew in&#xA;size. The radiance of his body filled&#xA;Angada and his companions with wonder&#xA;and joy.&#xA;From now on, Hanuman is the hero of&#xA;the Ramayana. The devotees of Vishnu&#xA;lovingly call him the Junior Servant of&#xA;Hari. The Senior Servant is Garuda who is&#xA;always&#xA;with&#xA;Vishnu&#xA;in&#xA;personal&#xA;attendance.&#xA;How the Junior Servant of Hari ended&#xA;the grief of Sita, destroyed by fire the city&#xA;of Ravana and returned to the Lord and&#xA;told him: &amp;ldquo;I found have Sita,&amp;rdquo; we shall&#xA;now proceed to relate. Reminded of his&#xA;might by Jambavan, Hanuman was now&#xA;determined to fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose. And&#xA;with fervor he uttered his faith:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;May your words come true. Flying&#xA;through the sky and alighting in Lanka, I&#xA;shall see Janaki. I have no doubt. I shall&#xA;return and bring you good news. To take&#xA;the jump I must press my foot hard&#xA;against the earth. This hill may stand it,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said and climbed up the Mahendra hill.&#xA;There for a while he threw his whole&#xA;strength into his foot and walked a few&#xA;steps. The creatures in the hill could not&#xA;endure it and came out.Standing on the hill, Hanuman looked&#xA;at the sea and directed his yoga-&#xA;concentrated mind towards Lanka. He&#xA;said to himself: &amp;ldquo;I shall search and find&#xA;Sita. I shall fly in the sky and cross the&#xA;sea.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With this resolve he offered worship&#xA;and prayer to Surya, Indra, Vayu, Brahma,&#xA;and all creation. Then facing east, he&#xA;made obeisance to his father Vayu and,&#xA;magnifying his frame still further, turned&#xA;towards the south.&#xA;He pressed the hill with his feet and&#xA;struck it with his hands. At this impact the&#xA;flowers fell from the trees and covered the&#xA;hill. Squeezed irresistibly by the pressure&#xA;of his feet the hill threw out springs of&#xA;water, like the rut flowing down the&#xA;cheeks of the elephant. Many colored&#xA;veins of ore burst out of the rock. From&#xA;the caves the beasts emerged with panic-&#xA;stricken&#xA;outcries.&#xA;Hooded&#xA;serpents&#xA;emitting venom bit the rock and sparks&#xA;flew out.&#xA;The hair of Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s body stood on&#xA;end and he roared and lashed his tail on&#xA;the ground. He contracted his hind parts,&#xA;held his breath, pressed down his feet,&#xA;folded his ears and stiffened his muscles.&#xA;Then with a roar of triumph he rose into&#xA;the sky and like Garuda flew with the&#xA;speed of Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrow. With the&#xA;momentum of his speed, many trees were&#xA;uprooted and followed in his wake. Like&#xA;friends who speed a parting guest, they&#xA;accompanied him a little way, showering&#xA;down their flowers, and dropped.&#xA;One by one the trees that followed&#xA;Hanuman fell into the sea like the&#xA;mountains which of old were pursued by&#xA;Indra and denuded of their wings.&#xA;Covered with bright-colored flowers the&#xA;sea shone like the sky with its stars.&#xA;Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s arms with their outspread&#xA;hands as he flew through the sky appeared&#xA;like two five headed cobras. He seemed to&#xA;swallow the sky as he flew forward. His&#xA;eyes glistened like mountain forests on&#xA;fire. His red nose shone like the evening&#xA;sun.&#xA;His huge frame spanned the sky like an&#xA;enormous comet. The air roared as he&#xA;sped fast. Beneath him his shadow&#xA;travelled like a ship on the sea. It looked&#xA;as though a huge mountain with wings&#xA;was flying in the sky. Hidden at times by&#xA;clouds and again emerging from them, he&#xA;shone like the moon sailing across the&#xA;sky. The Gandharvas showered flowers.&#xA;The Devarishis blessed him.&#xA;With courage equal to every occasion,&#xA;with foresight, skill and resolution,&#xA;Hanuman met and survived the trials on&#xA;the way. Shooting up suddenly from the&#xA;sea, a mighty mountain rose and stood, in&#xA;his way. Hanuman struck it with his chest&#xA;and the Mynaka Mountain yielded, like a&#xA;cloud struck by the wind.&#xA;The mountain said: &amp;ldquo;My son, I am&#xA;Mount Mynaka. My king Ocean bade me&#xA;help Sri Rama, the descendant of the&#xA;Sagara race. The Ocean is an old friend of&#xA;that race. In honor of that ancient,&#xA;association, stay here on me for a while.&#xA;You will fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose all the&#xA;better for this rest. When Indra struck with&#xA;his thunder all the hills, I fled from his&#xA;persecution and hid myself in the ocean&#xA;and survived. The Ocean who gave me&#xA;shelter now bids me help you. The sons of&#xA;Sagara dug and deepened the ocean. Did&#xA;not your father Vayu help me to escape&#xA;from Indra&amp;rsquo;s thunderbolt and find&#xA;sanctuary in the sea? Both the Ocean and&#xA;myself will be pleased if you will accept&#xA;my hospitality and rest here for a while.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Hanuman could not yield to&#xA;Mynaka&amp;rsquo;s importunity and said politely: &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;cannot stop, my friend. I have no time to&#xA;lose. My vow to fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose&#xA;permits no delay. Your kind words are&#xA;enough to please me.&amp;ldquo;He stroked the mountain affectionately&#xA;with his hand and took its leave.&#xA;Later, a huge form stood in his way&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;Enter my mouth. I have been&#xA;without food for a long time and am&#xA;eagerly waiting for you,&amp;rdquo; and the monster&#xA;opened its mouth wide like a cave.&#xA;Hanuman answered: &amp;ldquo;I am bent on&#xA;doing Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose. Do not stop me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Impossible!&amp;rdquo; said the monster. &amp;ldquo;You&#xA;must enter my mouth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman thought quickly and decided&#xA;what to do. Step by step he made his body&#xA;grow bigger and bigger. The Rakshasa&#xA;form (which had been assumed by Surasa,&#xA;the Naga maiden) opened its mouth&#xA;correspondingly wider and wider.&#xA;When the mouth was thus enormously&#xA;wide, all of a sudden Hanuman contracted&#xA;his body into a speck and, darting through&#xA;the demon&amp;rsquo;s mouth and body, came out&#xA;again and resumed his former normal&#xA;shape.&#xA;He then laughed and said: &amp;ldquo;You have&#xA;had your wish, mother. I have entered&#xA;your mouth. What more do you need?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And the Naga goddess blessed him&#xA;saying: &amp;ldquo;Your effort will be crowned with&#xA;success. I did this at the bidding of the&#xA;gods who wanted to test you. Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;purpose, which you seek to serve, will&#xA;assuredly triumph.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This was not the last of his trials. As he&#xA;was flying in the sky, for no reason which&#xA;he could discover, he found his speed&#xA;obstructed and he suffered like a ship&#xA;against a contrary wind. Some mighty&#xA;force, he felt, was holding him and&#xA;dragging him down.&#xA;He looked up and down and on all four&#xA;sides. Then he discovered the cause. It&#xA;was a huge she-demon in the sea holding&#xA;him by his shadow below, arresting his&#xA;speed, and dragging him down.&#xA;The demon, holding him by his&#xA;shadow, said: &amp;ldquo;Come, come! Long have I&#xA;been waiting for you. No longer can I bear&#xA;my hunger,&amp;rdquo; and she opened her mouth&#xA;like a cave.&#xA;At once Hanuman entered her mouth&#xA;and ripped a way out through her entrails&#xA;and emerged. The demon died and sank&#xA;down in the water. Like the full moon&#xA;emerging from an eclipse, Hanuman&#xA;shone in the sky and resumed his journey.&#xA;Thus surviving many trials with the&#xA;help of his subtle wit, courage and&#xA;strength, he flew across the ocean and&#xA;approached the coast of Lanka covered&#xA;with plantain and coconut trees.&#xA;On the shore of the island he saw&#xA;groves and mountains and forests and the&#xA;mouths of rivers.&#xA;Hanuman saw the wealth of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;kingdom and the beauty of the fortified&#xA;city.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have reached the destination,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Hanuman to himself. &amp;ldquo;Now without&#xA;letting the Rakshasas know who or what I&#xA;am, I must search the place and find out&#xA;where Sita is kept.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He reduced his huge form to the size of&#xA;a normal monkey and alighted on a hilltop&#xA;in Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FULL of hope, Hanuman alighted and&#xA;set foot in Lanka. But soon the flush of&#xA;triumph at the accomplishment of the&#xA;journey gave place to sober thinking.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;True I have crossed the sea, but that is&#xA;only the beginning of my mission. There,&#xA;on mount Trikuta, stands Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;magnificent city, as if suspended in the&#xA;sky. How beautiful, how wealthy, how&#xA;well secured it is! The city and the fortress&#xA;are not inferior to Amaravati or&#xA;Bhagavati. The lovely groves, the elegant&#xA;buildings, the engines of defence, deep&#xA;moats, these fill me with much admiration&#xA;but also with greater concern. Who can&#xA;attack and vanquish this Ravana? How&#xA;can an army cross the sea that I have justcrossed? Even if it crosses the sea and&#xA;reaches this shore, how can it attack and&#xA;bring down this fortress defended by&#xA;bulwarks manned by well-armed warriors!&#xA;Neither guile nor force can bring it down.&#xA;But first I must find out whether Sita is&#xA;alive or not. Other questions can wait.&#xA;When and how can I best enter this well&#xA;guarded city? I have to search it&#xA;thoroughly, if I am to discover the place&#xA;where Sita is kept. If thoughtlessly I do&#xA;something wrong now, this error would be&#xA;irretrievable and a great purpose would&#xA;fail because of haste or negligence on my&#xA;part. If I enter the, city by day, it will be&#xA;noticed by the Rakshasas. It is best I go in&#xA;at night. But in what shape shall I go? To&#xA;ward off suspicion, I must put on a trivial,&#xA;inconspicuous shape.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly he shrank to the size of a&#xA;little monkey, no bigger than a cat. To&#xA;enter and search the palaces and parks of&#xA;this vast city, this would be most&#xA;convenient. His present form was as much&#xA;smaller than his usual size as the latter&#xA;was than the mighty proportions he had&#xA;assumed as he crossed the sea.&#xA;By now the sun had set. The little&#xA;Vanara walked towards the fortress gate.&#xA;The moon shone brightly. Hanuman was&#xA;glad and grateful for this help in his&#xA;search.&#xA;Even on a distant view Hanuman&#xA;wondered at the wealth and beauty&#xA;displayed in Ravana&amp;rsquo;s capital. The streets&#xA;and mansions were bright with flags and&#xA;festoons and glittered with gold and&#xA;precious gems. The breeze blew gently&#xA;from the sea. Like Indra&amp;rsquo;s Amaravati and&#xA;Kubera&amp;rsquo;s Alakapuri, Ravana&amp;rsquo;s capital had&#xA;attained the peak of prosperity. The&#xA;messenger of Rama was filled with&#xA;wonder and anxiety how to overcome the&#xA;master of such wealth and military power.&#xA;As he was walking along in amazement&#xA;and anxiety, he was rudely accosted by&#xA;the terrible-looking Guardian Goddess of&#xA;the city.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Who are you, little monkey? How did&#xA;you manage to come here and why are&#xA;you here at all? Speak the truth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I am indeed a little monkey and I&#xA;have come here to look at this beautiful&#xA;city. I shall go back after I have gone&#xA;round and seen everything and satisfied&#xA;my curiosity.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The deity struck an angry blow at the&#xA;monkey. Hanuman returned the blow&#xA;carelessly with his left hand. It doubled&#xA;her up with agony on the ground.&#xA;But soon she got up and remembered&#xA;the prophecy that, when a monkey should&#xA;strike and throw her down, the city she&#xA;guarded would be destroyed.&#xA;She said to herself: &amp;ldquo;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s sins are&#xA;many and grievous. The end of Lanka is&#xA;approaching. The word of the gods is&#xA;about to be fulfilled.&amp;rdquo; And she stood aside.&#xA;The goddess of Lanka was not a servant&#xA;of Ravana. She was the spirit of the city.&#xA;Hanuman climbed over the wall and&#xA;jumped into the city. It was part of the&#xA;ancient code of warfare that one should&#xA;not enter the enemy&amp;rsquo;s fortress through the&#xA;regular gate, but should make his entry in&#xA;an out-of-the-way manner.&#xA;Vowing that the Rakshasas should be&#xA;destroyed he entered the fortress of Lanka&#xA;with his left foot foremost, for that meant&#xA;defeat for the enemy.&#xA;He went along the royal street that was&#xA;strewn with beautiful flowers. Like&#xA;lightning shining through the clouds the&#xA;buildings&#xA;shone&#xA;against&#xA;the&#xA;sky.&#xA;Clambering up the mansions and going&#xA;along on their roofs, he admired the&#xA;beauty of the city. The Rakshasa mansions&#xA;and streets and their decorations shone&#xA;with ineffable beauty. The sounds of&#xA;cultivated and correct music were heard.&#xA;Lovely women moved about to the&#xA;accompaniment of tinkling anklets. Thecity was filled with sounds indicating a&#xA;full and joyous life.&#xA;In some houses mantras were being&#xA;chanted. In some others Vedic chants&#xA;were heard. In others songs celebrating&#xA;the heroic exploits and glory of Ravana&#xA;were being sung. Soldiers and scouts were&#xA;everywhere. In the streets were people&#xA;dedicated to particular religious practices&#xA;and vows. There were others cruel in&#xA;looks and ugly. The guards were armed&#xA;with bows, swords, cudgels, slings, lances&#xA;and other weapons. All the warriors were&#xA;clad in armor.&#xA;Some were handsome, some ugly,&#xA;complexions varied from fair through&#xA;brown to black. Some figures were very&#xA;tall, others very short. Thus Hanuman saw&#xA;that the population had been drawn from a&#xA;wide area with varying climates and that&#xA;the army had been recruited from the pick&#xA;of many nations.&#xA;He examined mansion after mansion.&#xA;He saw women of exquisite beauty, some&#xA;of them in the company of their husbands&#xA;and others by themselves. He saw many&#xA;young damsels, bright and beautiful like&#xA;images of molten gold. Some were seated&#xA;on the terraces, others were sleeping in&#xA;their beds. Some were playing, others&#xA;singing.&#xA;Innumerable beautiful women he saw,&#xA;but not Sita pining for Rama. The sight of&#xA;so much beauty only filled Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;heart with disappointment and sadness.&#xA;He entered and examined the homes of&#xA;many Rakshasas. There were war&#xA;elephants, pure-bred horses, chariots and&#xA;armories. Soldiers stood fully armed.&#xA;After passing through many mansions&#xA;and gardens filled with merriment and&#xA;music, he came to a great palace rising&#xA;aloft in a nobility of splendor far&#xA;transcending all the magnificent buildings&#xA;around.&#xA;Looking at the elephants, horses and&#xA;foot-soldiers in front, the high walls&#xA;surrounding it and the beauty of its&#xA;structure and the richness of its&#xA;decorations, he concluded that this was&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s own palace, the central glory of&#xA;splendid Lanka. He entered this palace. It&#xA;was in every way a heaven on earth&#xA;worthy of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s peerless power and&#xA;glory. The park, the birds sporting there,&#xA;the shrines scattered here and there, filled&#xA;Hanuman with wonder.&#xA;He said to himself: &amp;ldquo;What wealth, what&#xA;beauty and what bliss!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He was for a while lost in amazement.&#xA;But soon he recollected that he had not yet&#xA;found Sita. Admiration gave place to&#xA;concern over the yet unfulfilled purpose&#xA;for which he had come.&#xA;Passing through many mansions, he&#xA;entered the innermost private apartment of&#xA;Ravana and was almost overcome with&#xA;the luxury and richness of its apartments&#xA;which made it look a very abode of the&#xA;gods. Everywhere was gold and silver,&#xA;ivory and gems and pearls, and beautiful&#xA;carpets and furniture and in their midst he&#xA;saw the Pushpaka Vimana.&#xA;It was a magic vehicle obtained from&#xA;Brahma by Kubera. Vanquishing Kubera,&#xA;Ravana brought it to Lanka as his booty.&#xA;As from Vasishtha&amp;rsquo;s cow, in the Pushpaka&#xA;car one could get anything one desired.&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s chamber, which Hanuman&#xA;now entered, was a very ocean of delight.&#xA;Countless lovely women lay sleeping in&#xA;the spacious chamber, some linked arm in&#xA;arm and all in undress and the careless&#xA;attitudes of sleep, making the place look&#xA;like garden of bright, flower-laden&#xA;creepers.&#xA;With his spirit controlled by dharma,&#xA;Hanuman looked at all these sleeping&#xA;women, each more beautiful than the&#xA;other and all filled with joy and love, to&#xA;see if any of them could be Sita. Ravana&amp;rsquo;spower to take what shape he would and to&#xA;please all women was evident from the&#xA;sight of these lovely women.&#xA;Hanuman pulled himself together&#xA;reproachfully at his own folly in&#xA;supposing for a moment that Sita could be&#xA;in that sensual paradise of happy damsels.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It is certain that Sita is not in this crowd.&#xA;What a fool am I to search for her in this&#xA;company! This is no place for her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then he went elsewhere. In another&#xA;chamber he saw many beds. He saw one&#xA;more gorgeous than the rest, covered with&#xA;gold and diamonds and Ravana stretched&#xA;on it, like another Mount Meru. His form&#xA;and majestic splendor mace made even&#xA;Hanuman tremble for it moment.&#xA;He stood on one side and scanned the&#xA;sleeping figure unable for a time to take&#xA;his eyes off the majestic and virile beauty&#xA;of that mighty form. The great muscles&#xA;now in repose, the symmetrical grace of&#xA;limbs which made the Rakshasa King at&#xA;once beautiful and terrible.&#xA;Then Hanuman looked at the women in&#xA;the beds around and on the carpets. Some,&#xA;who had fallen asleep while singing, were&#xA;still hugging their musical instruments.&#xA;His eyes finally fell on a figure lying&#xA;on a divinely beautiful cot. The&#xA;shapeliness of her limbs and the beauty of&#xA;her features made Hanuman imagine it&#xA;might be Sita. He leaped up with joy.&#xA;The next instant he cursed himself for&#xA;his folly. &amp;ldquo;Fie, fie,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;how foolish have I been! Could Sita&#xA;sleep thus carelessly, covered with jewels,&#xA;in a stranger&amp;rsquo;s chamber? The very thought&#xA;is a sin.&amp;rdquo; And he was overwhelmed with&#xA;shame and sorrow at his error.&#xA;Then he said to himself: &amp;ldquo;Because she&#xA;would not yield to him, this Rakshasa&#xA;must have killed her. What use is there in&#xA;continuing the search?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He had now searched the inner&#xA;apartments of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s palace. The&#xA;bedroom, the dining room, the hall of&#xA;drink, the music room, all places had been&#xA;searched and Sita was nowhere found. &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;have entered every nook and corner.&#xA;Against all the rules of propriety, I have&#xA;even looked at every one in the women&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chambers. But all in vain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this he left the hall of drink and&#xA;went to the garden and looked into the&#xA;little shrines and the arbours made of&#xA;creepers. But all was in vain.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have seen all of Lanka,&amp;rdquo; he thought&#xA;with irrepressible grief. &amp;ldquo;I have seen every&#xA;inch of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s palace. What more could&#xA;I do here? Am I to return without seeing&#xA;Sita? No. I shall rather end my life here.&#xA;Yes, that is the only thing for me to do.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But again he said to himself, &amp;ldquo;Fie, fie&#xA;on me for yielding to such despondency&#xA;unworthy and dishonorable.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He sprang up again and searched once&#xA;again every inch of the places he had been&#xA;through. He opened every door and&#xA;window and looked in. There were ugly&#xA;women, beautiful human and Naga&#xA;maidens, all captured by the Rakshasa, but&#xA;not Sita.&#xA;Once again his heart sank. He did not&#xA;know what to do. He said to himself: &amp;ldquo;If I&#xA;return to Kishkindha failing in my&#xA;mission, with what face shall I meet my&#xA;friends? If Rama loses all hopes of&#xA;recovering Sita, what would happen to&#xA;him? He would surely die. And after that,&#xA;what would happen to others? Instead of&#xA;going back to Sugriva and telling him that&#xA;all my labors have been wasted, it would&#xA;be far better to stay here and spend the&#xA;rest of my days in the forest and seashore&#xA;of Lanka. But why live on? Is it not best&#xA;to end my life? But, then, was Sampati&#xA;wrong in saying that Sita was in Lanka?&#xA;Or has she been killed by the Rakshasa&#xA;since Sampati sighted her in this island?&#xA;She might well have been devoured by theRakshasis. Nothing is clear, everything is&#xA;enveloped in doubt. What shall I do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus was Hanuman lost in anxiety and&#xA;thought. Just then his eyes lighted on what&#xA;he had so far left unexplored, a park&#xA;attached to a shrine and surrounded by&#xA;high walls. &amp;ldquo;Oh, here is a park, I have not&#xA;seen or searched so far. Here surely I shall&#xA;find Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With these words as the son of Vayu&#xA;meditated on Rama, hope sprang within&#xA;his breast. The secluded park was well&#xA;protected by high walls. &amp;ldquo;Yes, Sita must&#xA;be here,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself. Again he&#xA;bowed to the gods. He jumped up and sat&#xA;on the wall of the Asoka Vana and&#xA;surveyed the beautiful park.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As HANUMAN stood on the high&#xA;wall, he did not know why, a thrill of joy&#xA;passed through his frame. It was the&#xA;invisible atmosphere which envelopes an&#xA;accomplished mission and influences&#xA;subtly the devoted heart. As be had at last&#xA;reached the spot where Sita was, his&#xA;whole being throbbed with exulting&#xA;expectation without any apparent reason.&#xA;It was an early spring night. Trees and&#xA;plants were in flowers. Hanuman jumped&#xA;to a place where there was a thick cluster&#xA;of trees. This disturbed the birds that&#xA;rested there and they flew out with sweet&#xA;noises. Deer and other animals moved&#xA;about. Flowers dropped from the branches&#xA;and covered the body of Hanuman.&#xA;The creatures in the park, looking at&#xA;the lovely figure of Hanuman covered all&#xA;over with flowers, thought that the God of&#xA;spring was visiting the grove in the early&#xA;dawn.&#xA;The garden was entrancingly beautiful.&#xA;Lovely tanks, terraces decorated with&#xA;gold, silver, ivory, pearl and coral crystal&#xA;steps, artificial hills and waterfalls, the&#xA;sight filled Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s heart with joy.&#xA;Around some trees were platforms&#xA;overlaid with gold and silver. Little bells&#xA;suspended from the trees made music in&#xA;the breeze.&#xA;Hanuman climbed up and sat hidden&#xA;among the leaves of a tall spreading tree&#xA;with a golden platform around its stem. &amp;ldquo;If&#xA;she be alive and in Lanka &amp;quot; said Hanuman&#xA;to himself, &amp;ldquo;Sita would surely visit this&#xA;garden. She would choose this place&#xA;above all others for solitude and&#xA;contemplation of Rama. They said, did&#xA;they not, that she loved groves and trees?&#xA;She would surely come here at dawn to&#xA;offer worship to the Universal Mother.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He gazed all round, hiding himself&#xA;among the leaves. He sat on a branch and&#xA;looked below. He beheld a female figure&#xA;seated on that platform, blindingly&#xA;beautiful and divinely pure.&#xA;Thin and pale, she shone like the streak&#xA;of the moon in the beginning of the bright&#xA;half of the month. Her beauty glowed&#xA;fitfully through deepest dejection like&#xA;flame&#xA;through&#xA;enveloping&#xA;smoke.&#xA;Wrapped in a soiled upper garment she&#xA;resembled a lovely lotus obscured by miry&#xA;moss. Her face was bathed in tears, and&#xA;she was wan and thin for want of food.&#xA;She had no thoughts but of sorrow, no&#xA;glimpse of friends or hope. There were&#xA;only Rakshasis wherever she turned her&#xA;eyes, and she felt like a doe which had&#xA;lost its herd and found itself beset by a&#xA;pack of wild dogs.&#xA;A single snake-like braid of hair&#xA;wandered unregarded down to her hip.&#xA;She seemed to Hanuman at once adorable&#xA;and pitiful, like the holy word torn from&#xA;its context by infidels, like prosperity sunk&#xA;in unmerited ruin, like shattered hope and&#xA;faith betrayed, like frustrated fulfilment,&#xA;like intellect muddied by insanity, like&#xA;blameless purity besmirched by foul&#xA;slander.&#xA;Hanuman said to himself with&#xA;conviction: &amp;ldquo;This image of beautifuldespair is surely Sita. For, behold,&#xA;hanging unregarded on the branches of the&#xA;tree are the jewels described by Rama as&#xA;having been on her when she was carried&#xA;away, all except those which she dropped&#xA;during the flight and which were picked&#xA;up by us on the hill. And see the scarf she&#xA;wears, though soiled and crumpled, is the&#xA;fellow to the one we found. Surely this&#xA;sublimely beautiful lady, who seems like&#xA;one steadfast in true love in a tempest-&#xA;tossed sea of troubles, is Rama&amp;rsquo;s beloved&#xA;queen. It is for her that Rama is consumed&#xA;by a three-fold agony, grief for her&#xA;suffering, wrath for the insult to her and&#xA;heart-broken pangs at separation from her.&#xA;Surely he is ever in her heart and she in&#xA;his, and in truth they are not parted or they&#xA;could not live.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And as he continued to see her, his&#xA;heart leapt back across the ocean and&#xA;sought Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet in adoration. And&#xA;again he looked at Sita and said to&#xA;himself: &amp;ldquo;It was for the sake of this divine&#xA;lady that the mighty Vali, the peer of&#xA;Ravana in prowess, was slain. For her that&#xA;Kabandha and Viradha met their death,&#xA;and fourteen thousand fierce Rakshasas&#xA;with Khara, Dushana and Trisiras&#xA;crimsoned with their gore the glades of&#xA;Janasthana. It was for her that the splendid&#xA;sovereignty of the Vanaras was wrested&#xA;from the heroic Vali and given to Sugriva.&#xA;It is to do her service that I crossed the&#xA;sea, the lord of rivers, and am now here in&#xA;Lanka. All this seems much, but verily, if&#xA;for her sake Rama should transform or&#xA;even destroy the universe, I would say&#xA;from my soul it is well done! She is worth&#xA;it all and more!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And again Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s heart crossed the&#xA;sea back and dwelt on Rama far away.&#xA;Just then, as off the clear surface of a&#xA;lake a swan might glide, so in the blue sky&#xA;the moon swam into sight and shone&#xA;brightly as if on purpose to help the son of&#xA;Vayu.&#xA;Peering between the leaves and not&#xA;knowing what to do, Hanuman took&#xA;another long look at the face of Sita, a&#xA;face that disclosed a sea of care like a&#xA;heavily-laden ship caught in a storm. The&#xA;Rakshasis who guarded her were&#xA;intolerably ugly. One had only one eye,&#xA;another only one ear. Some were without&#xA;ears and some without noses. Some had&#xA;noses turned steeply upward. Some were&#xA;bald, while some had done their hair in&#xA;grotesque styles.&#xA;Some had pendant stomachs and some&#xA;had camel&amp;rsquo;s lips. Some were hunchbacks.&#xA;Some were dwarfs and some tall like&#xA;palmyrah trees. Swine-face, tiger-face,&#xA;buffalo-face, goat-face, all were to be&#xA;seen. These unsightly creatures were&#xA;holding spears and other weapons in their&#xA;hands.&#xA;And in their midst, the pale-faced&#xA;princess sat trembling, befriended only by&#xA;her virtue, like an unsupported beautiful&#xA;creeper fallen on the ground.&#xA;It was still dark and not yet dawn.&#xA;Ravana was roused from his slumber by&#xA;the chanting of the Vedas and the morning&#xA;songs of the court bards. The moment he&#xA;awoke, he thought of Sita and started&#xA;towards the park where she was kept.&#xA;With all his retinue, he entered the&#xA;palace park, accompanied by scented&#xA;torches&#xA;and&#xA;the&#xA;royal&#xA;umbrella,&#xA;surrounded by maidens, covered all over&#xA;with brilliant ornaments and clad in&#xA;spotless white clothes. Ravana appeared&#xA;charming like another Manmatha.&#xA;As the procession entered the gate,&#xA;Hanuman could hear the noise of the&#xA;crowd and the tinkling of women&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;anklets. Soon he saw the Rakshasa king&#xA;approaching. At once Hanuman hid&#xA;himself more effectively than before&#xA;among thick leaves.As Ravana came towards Sita, his&#xA;strength and splendor were wonderful to&#xA;behold. At this sight Sita&amp;rsquo;s body shrank&#xA;and trembled like a plantain tree in a&#xA;storm.&#xA;As one reads or listens to this sacred&#xA;story, one should form a mental image of&#xA;Sita in her present state. One can imagine&#xA;the agony of despair of any good woman&#xA;who has by misfortune fallen into the&#xA;power of a lustful man. What must be the&#xA;state of Sita, daughter of Janaka and wife&#xA;of Ramachandra, in such a predicament?&#xA;To appreciate Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s metaphors and&#xA;similes in this context, one should purify&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s heart and fire it with piety.&#xA;One feels unequal to rendering into&#xA;another language the beautiful similes by&#xA;which Valmiki illustrates her condition.&#xA;Only a few are cited here to give some&#xA;idea of them.&#xA;Ravana approached Sita still in the&#xA;hope of obtaining her consent. Sita was&#xA;covered with dust and had no jewels on&#xA;her person but she shone as if wearing all&#xA;the jewels that a princess must wear. She&#xA;looked like a beautiful tree felled down&#xA;and lying low.&#xA;Her face was covered by light and&#xA;shadow, like a lotus flower stained by&#xA;mire. She swayed like a cobra bound by&#xA;charms. Her state was like one surrounded&#xA;by raging fires on four sides, like an army&#xA;which had lost its chief warriors, like a&#xA;river which had run dry, like a vessel for&#xA;sacrificial fire that suffered desecration,&#xA;like a lovely lotus tank destroyed by&#xA;elephants, like a flowering creeper&#xA;uprooted and cast aside, like a cow&#xA;elephant separated from the leader of the&#xA;herd, captured and tied as a prisoner.&#xA;Sita sat trembling, overwhelmed with&#xA;grief and fear. When she perceived&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s approach, that very instant her&#xA;heart travelled to Rama like a chariot&#xA;drawn by swift steeds. With faded face&#xA;and wasted form, she thought of her&#xA;protectors far away. &amp;ldquo;When will they&#xA;come? Will they ever come?&amp;rdquo; she asked&#xA;herself and meditated on God.&#xA;Ravana approached and spoke to her.&#xA;Hidden in the branches of the tree,&#xA;Hanuman watched what went on below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>50 RAVANA&#39;S SOLICITATION</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TO SITA, plunged in a sea of sorrow&#xA;and clinging to dharma and to the thought&#xA;of her lord, Ravana spoke these words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O beautiful one! Why do you shrink&#xA;from me? Do you not see how much I care&#xA;for you? Though it is lawful for a&#xA;Rakshasa to take another&amp;rsquo;s wife and&#xA;possess her by force, I am a beggar for&#xA;your love. There is no need to fear me. I&#xA;shall never touch you till your heart turns&#xA;towards me. Do not be afraid. My one&#xA;wish is that you should care for me as I do&#xA;for you. You must accept me with&#xA;affection. Why do you make your body a&#xA;prey to unavailing sorrow? O beautiful&#xA;one! There is none like you in loveliness,&#xA;none in all the world. It is not right for&#xA;you to reject beautiful jewels, and clothes,&#xA;to sleep on the ground and leave your hair&#xA;unkempt. O gem among women, do not&#xA;thus waste your youth and beauty. Now&#xA;you have come under my protection, you&#xA;should lack nothing. All pleasures are&#xA;suitors for your selection. I cannot take&#xA;my eyes away from your face bright like&#xA;the full moon. Wherever on your body I&#xA;set my eyes, there they remain fixed and&#xA;immovable. Why should one with so&#xA;much beauty suffer so much sorrow?&#xA;Accept me and enjoy all the pleasures of&#xA;the world. I will conquer the world and&#xA;give it to Janaka for your sake. What will&#xA;I not do for you? You will be my&#xA;sovereign consort. All the queens and&#xA;women in the palace will be ruled by you.&#xA;My wealth, my kingdom, all shall be&#xA;yours to enjoy. Lanka and myself, why,&#xA;the whole earth, shall belong to you. Mystrength and courage are known to the&#xA;Devas and Asuras. Vanquished by me,&#xA;they stand with bowed heads.&#xA;With&#xA;jewels and garments fit for you my&#xA;handmaidens will adorn you. I long to see&#xA;you splendidly decked. And you will be&#xA;free to give away generous gifts in&#xA;charity. Your authority will extend over&#xA;all mankind. My subjects and kinsfolk&#xA;will deem it a joy to serve you. Why do&#xA;you waste your thoughts on wretched&#xA;Rama, wandering in the forest? How can&#xA;you love, how can you trust one who has&#xA;been deprived of his rights and driven out&#xA;of his kingdom and is roaming about clad&#xA;in bark garments? What can this helpless&#xA;fellow do? The Goddess of Wealth, she&#xA;that presides over power and she who&#xA;rules over success have all abandoned&#xA;him, and you know it. It is even doubtful&#xA;whether he is alive today. Anyhow, you&#xA;may take it, he will never set eyes on you&#xA;again, much less come near you. Like&#xA;Garuda seizing a serpent, you have&#xA;captivated my heart. I am unable to&#xA;escape. Even in your present state, devoid&#xA;of jewels or good clothes, you have drawn&#xA;me away from my other wives. What can I&#xA;do now? In my apartments are&#xA;innumerable lovely women. But after&#xA;seeing you, I can bear the sight of none of&#xA;them. You will be Queen over all of them&#xA;and receive their humble service. In what&#xA;sense can Rama equal me? Do you not see&#xA;that in severe austerities gone through, in&#xA;strength, wealth and glory, in every way I&#xA;am superior to him? Shake off your fear.&#xA;We shall wander over the whole world,&#xA;happy in each other&amp;rsquo;s company. With me&#xA;you will enjoy limitless wealth and&#xA;pleasure. Life will be one continuous joy.&#xA;O beautiful one, have pity on me. Let us&#xA;sport together in the parks and groves by&#xA;the sea. Only say &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Ravana uttered his impassioned&#xA;appeal for love and pity. When Ravana&#xA;had finished speaking, Sita plucked a little&#xA;blade of grass and, placing it between&#xA;them, laughed in derision and gently&#xA;spoke:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ravana, lay aside all such vain&#xA;thoughts concerning me. It is altogether&#xA;improper for you to desire me. Turn your&#xA;heart to your wives. Never can I agree to&#xA;what you say. Think of the family I was&#xA;born in. Think of the family I was married&#xA;into. How can you ever hope to persuade&#xA;me? Do not give room for such foolish&#xA;and impossible desires and make sorrow&#xA;for yourself!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then she turned her face away and&#xA;continued:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How can I become your wife, when I&#xA;am the wife of another? Do not violate&#xA;dharma. Do not tread the path of sin.&#xA;Listen to me. Think how carefully you&#xA;watch over your wives to keep them safe&#xA;from the touch of others. Would not other&#xA;husbands do the same by their wives?&#xA;Remember other men are like you. Do not&#xA;cast your eyes on another&amp;rsquo;s wife. To be&#xA;happy with your own is the way of true&#xA;happiness. But if you allow your mind to&#xA;dwell on another&amp;rsquo;s wife, sorrow and&#xA;dishonor will be your portion. Is there&#xA;none in the world to advise you aright?&#xA;Why do you do evil and bring destruction&#xA;on yourself and on your people? When a&#xA;king loses self-control, his kingdom and&#xA;wealth will all be destroyed. Be sure, this&#xA;Lanka and its great wealth will be utterly&#xA;destroyed if you persist in your sin and the&#xA;foes whom you have conquered and&#xA;humiliated will rejoice. I have no use for&#xA;the wealth and the pleasures that you&#xA;promise. They do not tempt me. I have&#xA;married Rama and I cannot take my mind&#xA;and heart away from him. I, who held his&#xA;hand, can never touch another, never. I am&#xA;his, the prince&amp;rsquo;s, entirely and forever. I&#xA;belong to him, as the Veda belongs to one&#xA;who has reverently mastered it. It is notright for anyone else to look on me with&#xA;longing eyes. Listen to me who speaks for&#xA;your good. Beg Rama humbly for&#xA;forgiveness and escape from his anger. Do&#xA;not go in search of your own ruin. Rama&#xA;is generous and will surely forgive you if&#xA;you seek his mercy. Seek forgiveness and&#xA;safety. Do not seek death and destruction.&#xA;There, I hear even now the twang of&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s bow. You cannot escape. Yama&#xA;stands very near, ready to carry you away.&#xA;The arrows of Rama and Lakshmana will&#xA;soon be here in Lanka and your city will&#xA;be in flames. Did not Rama utterly destroy&#xA;the Rakshasas at Janasthana? Did you not,&#xA;knowing his strength, come like a thief to&#xA;our hut, when Rama and Lakshmana were&#xA;away, to steal me? Can you for a moment&#xA;stand before them face to face? Can a dog&#xA;approach a tiger? Will it not flee from the&#xA;very scent? As the sun sucks up moisture&#xA;from the wet earth, Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;will drink your life. Will you run to hide&#xA;yourself among the mountains? Will you&#xA;try to escape under the sea? Even then, as&#xA;at the appointed hour the tree is struck by&#xA;lightning, so will you perish at their&#xA;hands. You cannot escape.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Sita ended with a stern warning.&#xA;Ravana controlled his anger and spoke:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O Sita, doting on this spurious ascetic&#xA;Rama, you talk foolishly and repay my&#xA;loving words with insult and contumely.&#xA;Because of my love for you, I have&#xA;refrained, else you would be dead by now.&#xA;Of the time I had allowed you, two&#xA;months more remain. Change your mind&#xA;before they pass. Be my wife and come to&#xA;my bed. If you refuse, you will be sent to&#xA;my kitchen and cooked for my meal.&#xA;Beware!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It was well-known that the food of the&#xA;Rakshasas included human flesh. Hence&#xA;this threat of Ravana was no exaggeration,&#xA;but conveyed a clear possibility. Yet Sita&#xA;was unafraid, and answered:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas! Alas! Is there none to give you&#xA;good advice? Have you no friend to save&#xA;you from this sin and put you on the path&#xA;of virtue? You cannot escape Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;punishment. Like a rabbit antagonising a&#xA;wild elephant you have incurred the wrath&#xA;of Rama. O wretch, who stole me in his&#xA;absence, are you not ashamed? Your&#xA;destruction is certain. Your evil fate has&#xA;driven you to this act. And yet you are the&#xA;brother of Kubera. You are famous as a&#xA;warrior. You are the master of a complete&#xA;four-limbed army. Why should you do&#xA;this mean deed in this mean way?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s eyes rolled in anger and he&#xA;looked fiercely at Sita, hissing like a&#xA;snake. Seeing his mounting anger, one of&#xA;his young wives, Dhanyamali walked up&#xA;to his side and, embracing him, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King! Why do you vex yourself over&#xA;this mean human creature who does not&#xA;seem to care for you? She has not the&#xA;good fortune to be your wife, that is all.&#xA;And what is there so attractive about her?&#xA;Why do you waste your thoughts on this&#xA;puny creature? Come away. Let us enjoy&#xA;ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She drew him away affectionately and&#xA;the Rakshasa went with her, laughing.&#xA;Before he went, Ravana ordered the&#xA;Rakshasis who guarded Sita to bring her&#xA;round somehow, and with resounding&#xA;steps left the Asoka park, followed by his&#xA;retinue. As soon as he turned his back, the&#xA;Rakshasis surrounded Sita.&#xA;The princess, who had been bold up till&#xA;now, trembled when she looked at these&#xA;ugly creatures that began speaking to her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;When Ravana, scion of a noble&#xA;family, a world-famous warrior, desires&#xA;you,&amp;rdquo; said one, &amp;ldquo;how can you refuse him,&#xA;O foolish girl? Who do you think Ravana&#xA;is? Know that he is a direct descendant of&#xA;Brahma. He is the grandson of Pulastya&#xA;Prajapati, son of Brahma, a hero who haswon many battles and vanquished many&#xA;foes. How foolish to slight him!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let not pride ruin you,&amp;rdquo; said another.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ravana is the son of rishi Visravas. Do&#xA;not think he is a nobody. Accept him and&#xA;be happy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The king of the Rakshasas, who&#xA;defeated in battle and put to flight the&#xA;gods of heaven, invites you to be his&#xA;wife,&amp;rdquo; said another. &amp;ldquo;You must yield, poor&#xA;girl, or you must die.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Slighting all his other wives,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;another, &amp;ldquo;Ravana wants you and promises&#xA;to make you chief among his queens.&#xA;Forsaking all his noble wives, the King,&#xA;bewitched by your beauty, begs for your&#xA;love and offers to make you first among&#xA;his consorts. Why are you foolishly&#xA;obstinate?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;None in all the world can equal Lord&#xA;Ravana,&amp;rdquo; said another. &amp;ldquo;Good fortune&#xA;comes seeking you and you spurn it. How&#xA;foolish!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The Sun and the Wind gods are afraid&#xA;of the Rakshasa king. And he comes&#xA;seeking you and wants to make you his&#xA;favorite wife! Do not let your pride betray&#xA;you. Do not reject the fortune that comes&#xA;to you unsought.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And another concluded: &amp;ldquo;We have&#xA;given you good advice. We have done our&#xA;best and we leave the rest to you. If you&#xA;reject his offer, you must surely die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE boldest and most strong-minded&#xA;woman may, if kept in captivity for a long&#xA;period, lose heart and become depressed.&#xA;Sita hoped month after month that her&#xA;lord would discover her whereabouts and&#xA;come to her rescue. Sick with&#xA;disappointed hope, alone in the midst of&#xA;enemies, she clung to life only from an&#xA;abiding faith in the love of Rama that&#xA;made her feel that he would surely come.&#xA;The Rakshasis plied her with what&#xA;from their point of view was well-meant&#xA;counsel. &amp;ldquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t you listen to our advice?&#xA;You are a human and so lack sense. You&#xA;still hold on to this wretched man-husband&#xA;of yours. Your proper place is our King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;bedchamber. That is the place for every&#xA;kind of pleasure. But spurning his offer,&#xA;you are forever thinking of your worthless&#xA;husband. Why are you still fond of this&#xA;luckless wretch driven out of his&#xA;kingdom? You will never see him again.&#xA;Yield to Ravana and be happy.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita, hearing these words, could only&#xA;shed tears.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What sinful words you utter!&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;said. &amp;ldquo;Never can I do what you say. You&#xA;tell me that Rama is poor, wretched, and&#xA;an exiIe from his home. All this I know.&#xA;But among us of the race of men, no wife&#xA;would think of giving up her husband on&#xA;such grounds. It is wicked for the&#xA;Rakshasa king to desire me for his wife.&#xA;As&#xA;the&#xA;sun&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;brightness&#xA;belongs&#xA;inseparably to the sun so do I belong to&#xA;Rama. As Sachi is faithful to Indra, or&#xA;Arundhati to Vasishtha, so am I ever to&#xA;Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasis gave up all hopes of&#xA;persuading her and said to one another:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What can one do with a stubborn fool&#xA;like this? It is best to eat her before she&#xA;gets too thin with brooding!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am in the family way,&amp;rdquo; said one. &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;have a great longing for human flesh. I&#xA;shall tear her out and make a meal of her&#xA;soft body. We shall strangle her and report&#xA;to Ravana that she died of grief,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;another. &amp;ldquo;The King is lost in unavailing&#xA;grief because of this obstinate woman.&#xA;Once he knows that she is dead, he will&#xA;forget all about her and sleep soundly.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Another said: &amp;ldquo;I long to eat her liver. It&#xA;must be very tasty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Another added decisively: &amp;ldquo;Let us kill&#xA;her and share her limbs. Fetch some sauce&#xA;and strong liquor. Let us feast on her anddrink and dance in the temple of&#xA;Nikumbhila.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these horrible words and&#xA;seeing these terrible forms, Sita broke&#xA;down and cried aloud. Her physical&#xA;courage failed and nature had its way. She&#xA;sobbed like a child. But even in her sobs&#xA;her mind was clear and it was fixed on&#xA;Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;In&#xA;Janasthana&#xA;Rama&#xA;destroyed&#xA;thousands of Rakshasas. Why does not&#xA;Rama come yet to redeem me? The&#xA;warrior princes who killed Viradha in&#xA;Dandaka, why are they still indifferent to&#xA;my fate? It could only be that they do not&#xA;yet know where I am! Jatayu, the vulture&#xA;king, was slain by the Rakshasa. If he at&#xA;least were alive, he would have told them&#xA;the news that he saw the Rakshasa&#xA;carrying me. But he gave up his life in&#xA;trying to save me. But how long, will&#xA;Rama remain ignorant of my being here?&#xA;How long can Lanka and the Rakshasas&#xA;survive? It is certain that, in every house&#xA;in this city, Rakshasa widows will soon be&#xA;lamenting loudly. It is certain that this city&#xA;of Ravana and the whole Rakshasa race&#xA;will perish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus she thought within herself and&#xA;slowly recovered courage. But soon again&#xA;other thoughts came to her and filled her&#xA;with gloom.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Could it be that Rama gave up his life,&#xA;unable to bear my loss? It might well be&#xA;so. Otherwise, could he neglect me and&#xA;leave me all alone these so many days?&#xA;Indeed he is happy now and with the&#xA;Gods. I must have been guilty of many&#xA;sins to be thus left to suffer. My heart&#xA;must be made of stone. How else can I&#xA;suffer all this and yet survive? Yet&#xA;something tells me that Rama is alive else&#xA;I should be dead!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then again another thought occurred to&#xA;her. &amp;ldquo;Perhaps he has resolved to spend his&#xA;life in penance and has laid aside all&#xA;thought of me. No, no. How could a&#xA;warrior forsake his duty and, leaving his&#xA;wife in the hands of his foe, take up the&#xA;life of sanyasa? How foolish of me even&#xA;to think of this! The fact is that they do&#xA;not know where I am. Could it be that&#xA;Rama has lost his love for me? &amp;lsquo;Out of&#xA;sight, out of mind,&amp;rsquo; they say. Could it be&#xA;that he has forgotten me? Fie, fie! What a&#xA;sinful thought! How can my Rama forget&#xA;me? He never can. And what wrong have&#xA;I committed that he should cease to think&#xA;of me? This cannot be the reason. Perhaps&#xA;Ravana has played some trick and&#xA;treacherously slain the prince.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus her mind wandered from one sad&#xA;thought to another and sank ever deeper in&#xA;the sea of sorrow. She decided that it was&#xA;best by hanging herself. She could hang&#xA;herself with her long braid of hair round&#xA;her neck and jump down from a branch of&#xA;the Simsupa tree.&#xA;Having failed in their attempt to&#xA;persuade Sita, the Rakshasis did not know&#xA;what to do next. Some went to inform&#xA;Ravana of their failure. Some stayed&#xA;behind to look after Sita.&#xA;Appearing among them Trijata, a&#xA;Rakshasi, reprimanded them, saying: &amp;ldquo;O&#xA;foolish ones, you are talking nonsense!&#xA;Listen to me, I shall tell you of a dream&#xA;that I dreamt. The time has come when&#xA;Lanka shall be destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then she proceeded to recount in detail&#xA;the terrible dream that she had dreamt:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I saw in my dream Rama, shining like&#xA;a sun, come to Lanka to find Sita. I saw&#xA;Ravana entering the abode of Yama. I saw&#xA;Rama mounting Sita on his elephant and&#xA;carrying her home. I saw Ravana and all&#xA;the Rakshasas, clad in soiled garments and&#xA;dragged away by Yama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Relating this dream to the Rakshasis,&#xA;Trijata warned them: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t persecute this&#xA;saintly woman. Don&amp;rsquo;t seek your owndestruction. Fall at her feet and beg for&#xA;grace.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even as Trijata was speaking to her&#xA;companions, Sita, who resolved to slay&#xA;herself, suddenly began to see many good&#xA;omens.&#xA;Her left eyelids, hand, and foot&#xA;throbbed auspiciously. A vague courage&#xA;once again came into her heart. All ideas&#xA;of self-destruction disappeared.&#xA;Hanuman, sitting hidden above and&#xA;watching all that happened in the grove,&#xA;wondered what he should do next.&#xA;One might imagine that, having&#xA;reached Lanka and seen Sita, Hanuman&#xA;had nothing more to do. But he was not so&#xA;easily satisfied. He thought within&#xA;himself.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have done something which no one&#xA;else could do. I have crossed the sea and&#xA;discovered Sita. I have seen the city of the&#xA;Rakshasas and noted its defences. All that&#xA;a spy can do without revealing himself to&#xA;the foe, I have done. But the situation here&#xA;is fraught with danger. If I go back now to&#xA;report what I have seen to Rama and my&#xA;king, who knows what meanwhile will&#xA;happen here? Before Rama, Lakshmana&#xA;and the Vanara host arrive here, Sita,&#xA;unable to bear her suffering, might put an&#xA;end to her life. All my labors would then&#xA;be lost. It is not enough to have seen Sita.&#xA;I must talk to her, give her news of Rama&#xA;and put hope and courage into her heart,&#xA;so that she may hold with life in spite of&#xA;all. How would Rama receive me if I&#xA;return without speaking to Sita? I must&#xA;find some way of speaking to Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;In the rosary of Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s name&#xA;occurs&#xA;the&#xA;title,&#xA;Buddhimatam&#xA;Varishtham, &amp;lsquo;First among the Astute.&amp;rsquo; It is&#xA;a true description.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;In what form should I appear before&#xA;Sita? In what language should I speak to&#xA;her? If suddenly a monkey came and&#xA;spoke to her in this Asoka grove, Sita&#xA;would surely suspect foul play and&#xA;imagine that Ravana was playing some&#xA;new trick on her. If I appeared suddenly&#xA;before her, she might cry out in fear. In&#xA;her present condition this is most likely to&#xA;happen. The Rakshasis guarding her, who&#xA;have now fallen asleep, will be startled&#xA;awake and discover me. They would&#xA;know that I have come from their enemy&#xA;and in disguise, and they would bring the&#xA;Rakshasas to attack me. A great battle&#xA;would ensue. Of course I shall slay most&#xA;of them. But the task of comforting Sita&#xA;and bearing news of her to Rama would&#xA;be jeopardised if I were to be captured and&#xA;held a prisoner here. This would never do.&#xA;Even if I escape being caught and come&#xA;out successful in the struggle, I might be&#xA;wounded and lose strength and be unable&#xA;to cross the sea. What then would I have&#xA;gained having seen Sita? One should&#xA;never do things in a hurry. One should&#xA;keep in mind one&amp;rsquo;s main business. King&#xA;Sugriva and Rama are confidently&#xA;awaiting my return. Even a little fault on&#xA;my part now may lead to great disaster.&#xA;The first thing to do is to speak with Sita&#xA;and put joy and hope in her heart. I must&#xA;approach her in such a way that she can&#xA;never for a moment entertain a doubt&#xA;about my good faith. Well, I shall recite in&#xA;a sweet low tone, and for her hearing&#xA;only, the story and virtues of Rama. Her&#xA;heart would then be filled with joy and&#xA;trust, displacing suspicion. Only thus can I&#xA;proceed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So he thought and, still hidden by the&#xA;branches of the tree, he began to utter in a&#xA;low voice, the sweet words, &amp;ldquo;Rama,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rama.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HIDDEN by the branches, Hanuman&#xA;sang in a sweet and gentle voice the story&#xA;of Rama so that it fell on Sita&amp;rsquo;s ears:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King Dasaratha ruled his kingdom&#xA;well. His army was mighty and comprisedof chariots, elephants and horses. He was&#xA;virtuous and a doer of great deeds. He&#xA;kept his word and was foremost among&#xA;the famous kings of the world. He was&#xA;equal to the rishis in virtue and to Indra in&#xA;statesmanship. He hated no one and&#xA;harmed no one. All his endeavors were&#xA;crowned with success. Therefore men&#xA;called him Satya-parakrama, truly valiant.&#xA;The richest of the Ikshavaku race, a king&#xA;of kings, the ruler of the world, he&#xA;enjoyed and communicated happiness.&#xA;The eldest of his four sons was&#xA;Ramachandra, whose face was like the&#xA;full moon. Wise, virtuous and a master of&#xA;the bow, Rama was beloved of all. And he&#xA;was full of kindness for all the people in&#xA;the kingdom, a warrior wedded to dharma.&#xA;He was the heir to the throne. And yet, to&#xA;preserve the honor of his father, he left the&#xA;kingdom with his wife Sita and his brother&#xA;Lakshmana and lived in the forest. There&#xA;he vanquished the Rakshasas and&#xA;protected the rishis. He destroyed Khara&#xA;and Dushana and their mighty army.&#xA;Coming to hear of this, Ravana, bent on&#xA;revenge, induced a Rakshasa to assume&#xA;the form of a deer and beguile the princes&#xA;in pursuit and, in their absence, carried off&#xA;Sita by force. Grief-struck Rama went in&#xA;search of Sita. He met Sugriva, the&#xA;Vanara, and made friends with him. Rama&#xA;slew Vali, the Vanara king, and secured to&#xA;his brother Sugriva the Vanara kingdom.&#xA;And Sugriva sent his Vanara warriors to&#xA;all the quarters of the globe to find out&#xA;where Sita was. These Vanara warriors,&#xA;who could assume what shape they would,&#xA;searched the whole world for the missing&#xA;Sita. Following a clue given by Sampati, I&#xA;crossed the sea a hundred yojanas broad,&#xA;and have come here. And now I see one&#xA;whose form, complexion and qualities are&#xA;those described to me by Rama as his&#xA;royal spouse&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having said this, Hanuman paused.&#xA;These sweet words, uttered by some&#xA;one from somewhere, filled Sita with&#xA;wonder and delight. She looked around in&#xA;all directions to discover who conveyed&#xA;such sweet matter in so sweet a voice and&#xA;in such exquisite language.&#xA;She looked round, and up and down&#xA;but found no human form to match this&#xA;perfect speech. She only saw a lovely&#xA;little monkey seated on the branch above&#xA;her. Sita saw the son of Vayu, the wise&#xA;minister of the Vanara king, in the form of&#xA;a little monkey, radiant like the rising sun.&#xA;The reader should imagine for himself&#xA;the joy of Rama&amp;rsquo;s messenger, as Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;eyes fell on him. The reader who&#xA;experiences this joy will find God in his&#xA;heart. Narayana, who is waiting eagerly to&#xA;enter and take possession of our hearts,&#xA;would leave the great and boundless&#xA;ocean of milk and come to dwell within&#xA;us, when we cleanse ourselves of sinful&#xA;thoughts.&#xA;Seeing Hanuman, Sita said to herself:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The words I heard the form I see, they&#xA;cannot be real. I am only dreaming. One&#xA;sees in one&amp;rsquo;s dream what one is constantly&#xA;brooding over. How often has my mind&#xA;dwelt on the story of my Lord! Is it any&#xA;wonder then that I seem to hear the tale as&#xA;told by some one? It is not real. It is only&#xA;a dream. They say that if one sees a&#xA;monkey in a dream, it forebodes evil to&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s kinsfolk. May God protect Rama&#xA;from harm! May God keep all harm away&#xA;from Lakshmana! May God bless all my&#xA;kinsfolk in Mithila! No, no, this is no&#xA;dream. My eyes are open and I see the&#xA;same form still seated above me. There it&#xA;is, clear and solid. No, this is no dream.&#xA;And I am not asleep. How can one dream&#xA;without sleeping? This is no dream. All&#xA;this is real. Oh Gods! Could this indeed be&#xA;a messenger from my dear Lord? Oh grant&#xA;that it be so! Oh Vachaspati! Master of&#xA;speech, I salute you. Oh Agni! I saluteyou. Oh Swayambhu! I salute you. Oh&#xA;Gods! Protect me. May this be Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;messenger!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman, radiant with the joy of&#xA;seeing Sita, descended to the ground and&#xA;stood before her, palms joined and head&#xA;bent in salutation.&#xA;And he said in a deep soothing voice:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother, tears are falling from your eyes&#xA;like drops from lotus petals. May I know&#xA;who you are, who stands there, leaning on&#xA;the tree trunk, face clouded with sorrow&#xA;and eyes wet with tears? Are you a&#xA;goddess or a Naga maiden? The radiance&#xA;of your body makes me question whether&#xA;you could be of merely terrestrial birth!&#xA;Are you Rohini separated for a while from&#xA;the Moon-god? Or are you Arundhati&#xA;parted from sage Vasishtha? No, on closer&#xA;observation, you seem to be a human&#xA;woman, maybe a princess adorable in&#xA;your distress. Please tell me who indeed&#xA;you are. May God bless you! Are you the&#xA;princess Sita carried off by Ravana from&#xA;Janasthana? Is mine the bliss of seeing&#xA;Sita, the beloved of Rama?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita was beside herself with joy. &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;child,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;indeed I am Sita,&#xA;daughter of the king of Videha and Sri&#xA;Ramachandra&amp;rsquo;s spouse. For twelve years I&#xA;enjoyed all happiness with him in&#xA;Ayodhya. In the thirteenth year, King&#xA;Dasaratha made preparations to crown my&#xA;husband. Then Kaikeyi, his youngest&#xA;wife, reminded him of boons he had&#xA;granted long ago, and demanded that in&#xA;redemption of his word he should crown&#xA;her son Bharata king, and exile Rama to&#xA;the forest. She threatened to kill herself if&#xA;this was not done. Bound by promise the&#xA;king had to yield to her insistence. At his&#xA;bidding Rama relinquished the crown and&#xA;betook himself to the forest not only&#xA;without regret, but happy that it was given&#xA;to him to enable his father to keep his&#xA;plighted word. I refused to be left behind&#xA;and insisted on going with my lord into&#xA;the forest. Even before me, Lakshmana&#xA;had put on bark-garments, determined to&#xA;accompany his brother to the forest and&#xA;serve him. The three of us entered the&#xA;forest and were living in Dandaka. One&#xA;day the evil-hearted Ravana carried me&#xA;off by force. And he has kept me a&#xA;prisoner here in this Asoka garden. Of the&#xA;time limit of twelve months he has set for&#xA;me, only two more months remain. When&#xA;they are over I shall end my life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus spoke the helpless princess in her&#xA;sorrow.&#xA;The speeches of Hanuman and of&#xA;Janaki are sung by Valmiki in two brief&#xA;chapters. As Hari appeared before the&#xA;emperor Bali in the form of Vamana and&#xA;measured the universe in two steps, so&#xA;Valmiki has given the tale of Rama in a&#xA;short recital by Hanuman and another by&#xA;Sita. What greater joy can we have than&#xA;reading Hanuman and Sita telling the&#xA;divine story themselves? As Vamana got&#xA;the better of Bali and saved him from his&#xA;ahankara, may this tale of Rama as told by&#xA;Hanuman and Sita rid us of the sense of &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;&#xA;and &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;Sita concluded her story with the&#xA;statement that two more months remained&#xA;of the allotted twelve-month term and that&#xA;her life would then end. To Sita&#xA;overwhelmed by grief, Hanuman spoke&#xA;words of comfort.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O princess of Videha! Rama, the&#xA;noblest of men and the mightiest of&#xA;warriors has sent me to you with good&#xA;news. His beloved brother Lakshmana,&#xA;ever anxious for your welfare, sends&#xA;through me his salutations to you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ah! What happiness is mine!&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;exclaimed. &amp;ldquo;I now see the truth of the&#xA;common saying that so long as life lasts&#xA;there is hope.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus between these two utter strangers&#xA;a profound confidence and affectionsprang up like the sudden blossoming of&#xA;the Parijata in Indra&amp;rsquo;s garden. Yet when, in&#xA;his joyful eagerness to console and&#xA;encourage Sita, Hanuman took a nearer&#xA;step towards her, Sita lost the confidence&#xA;inspired by his words and again grew&#xA;suspicious.&#xA;She shut her eyes and moved away&#xA;further from the tree. Hanuman, noticing&#xA;this, withdrew respectfully and stood with&#xA;hands clasped in obeisance.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have been deceived,&amp;rdquo; she cried.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are no other than Ravana. Once you&#xA;came disguised as an ascetic and imposed&#xA;on me. Now you have come again in&#xA;another disguise and speak sweet words.&#xA;All this will bring you no good. Why do&#xA;you torture me, O Ravana? I am weary&#xA;and full of sorrow. You call yourself a&#xA;warrior. Is it a warrior&amp;rsquo;s part to persecute a&#xA;helpless woman?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then she opened her eyes and thought&#xA;again, &amp;ldquo;No, no. This cannot be Ravana.&#xA;Trust and friendship spring in my heart at&#xA;the sight of him. He can be no enemy of&#xA;mine. It is wrong to suspect him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She addressed him saying: &amp;ldquo;O Vanara!&#xA;Are you indeed a messenger sent by&#xA;Rama? May God bless you. Tell me more&#xA;concerning Rama. Let my ears hear and&#xA;my heart rejoice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then once again doubts assailed her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Am I a victim of delusion, imagining&#xA;good news? Is this a dream that mocks me&#xA;with the illusion of joy to make my&#xA;despair blacker when I am awake? Am I&#xA;in my right senses? Of course, I am. My&#xA;thoughts, my words are all normal. I am&#xA;sane and sensible. But then he says that he&#xA;crossed the sea a hundred yojannas broad.&#xA;No, no. This cannot be true. He is Ravana&#xA;and none else.&amp;rdquo; So she concluded in her&#xA;mind and without lifting her eyes to look&#xA;at Hanuman sat apart in silence.&#xA;Hanuman understood her doubts and&#xA;fears. They were natural in one who had&#xA;been deceived by the Rakshasa. He&#xA;thought for a while and realised that the&#xA;only approach to her confidence was to&#xA;awaken hope and joy in her sorely tired&#xA;heart by extolling Rama and harping on&#xA;the certainty of her rescue and his victory.&#xA;And he began: &amp;ldquo;Rama has sent me.&#xA;Rama is radiant like the Sun. Rama is&#xA;pleasant to look at like the moon. Rama is&#xA;praised by all the rulers of the earth. Rama&#xA;is valiant like Vishnu. Rama is wise like&#xA;Brihaspati. Rama is handsome like&#xA;Manmatha the god of love. Rama&amp;rsquo;s words&#xA;are ever sweet and true. Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;indignation is ever righteous and well&#xA;directed. Rama is the peerless warrior.&#xA;Rama has sent me. While a Rakshasa in&#xA;the shape of a deer beguiled Rama and&#xA;drew him away in the forest, you were left&#xA;alone and Ravana carried you off by&#xA;force. Soon he will pay dearly for this evil&#xA;deed. You will see it with your own eyes.&#xA;Soon the shafts of Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;will strike Lanka and destroy it along with&#xA;Ravana and all his race. At Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;bidding have I come to you to learn about&#xA;your safety which is his constant concern.&#xA;On Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s behalf I place at your&#xA;feet his respectful salutations. And so too&#xA;homage from Sugriva, the Vanara king.&#xA;Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva are ever&#xA;thinking of you. It is my good fortune to&#xA;have seen you alive. Now there will be no&#xA;more of loss of time. Soon Rama,&#xA;Lakshmana and Sugriva, accompanied by&#xA;the whole Vanara army, will descend on&#xA;Lanka. I am Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s minister. My name&#xA;is Hanuman. I crossed the sea and reached&#xA;Lanka. You may take it that my foot is&#xA;already on the head of the evil-minded&#xA;Ravana. By Rama&amp;rsquo;s grace, even more than&#xA;by my own prowess have I, his servant,&#xA;crossed the sea to behold you. Do not&#xA;suspect me. Have faith in my words,&#xA;mother.&amp;rdquo; So said Hanuman with tears in&#xA;his eyes. These sweet words of Hanumanacting on her great love for Rama and&#xA;confidence in him, put an end to Sita&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;fears and gave her courage and faith.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Forgive my suspicion, O Vanara&#xA;friend,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Deceived by the&#xA;Rakshasa and surrounded by his artifices,&#xA;I am prone to needless fear. O friend and&#xA;messenger of Rama! How did you first&#xA;meet Rama? How did the Prince make&#xA;friends with the Vanaras? Tell me all&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;To confirm her faith, Hanuman&#xA;recounted once again the virtues and&#xA;attractive&#xA;qualities&#xA;of&#xA;Rama&#xA;and&#xA;Lakshmana. He said: &amp;ldquo;What wonder is&#xA;there in Rama becoming friends with me&#xA;and my king and the Vanaras when the&#xA;whole world lives and finds bliss by his&#xA;loving kindness?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He proceeded to describe fully how the&#xA;quarrel arose between Vali and Sugriva,&#xA;how the latter first met Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana, how they became friends,&#xA;how Rama promised to slay Vali and&#xA;secure the Vanara kingdom for Sugriva,&#xA;how the Vanaras had picked up and&#xA;preserved the jewels dropped by Sita, how&#xA;with mounting sorrow Rama recognised&#xA;them, how Vali was slain and Sugriva&#xA;crowned, how after the rainy sea son was&#xA;over the Vanara hosts searched the whole&#xA;world for Sita, how the party led by&#xA;Angada and proceeding south having&#xA;failed to find her, decided to fast to death,&#xA;how they met Sampati and received a clue&#xA;from him, how he, Hanuman, crossed the&#xA;sea and searched the inner apartments of&#xA;Ravana, all this he recounted.&#xA;At the end of the narration he placed in&#xA;her hand Rama&amp;rsquo;s signet ring that he had&#xA;brought. Sita received the ring and pressed&#xA;it to her eyes with joy. Now all fear of&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s deceit and Rakshasa magic was&#xA;over. She had complete faith in Hanuman&#xA;and infinite affection for him.&#xA;&amp;quot; My child!&amp;quot; she said, &amp;ldquo;how foolish&#xA;was my error! How could I suspect one&#xA;like you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The son of Vayu explained to her who&#xA;he was and who his father was and what&#xA;his own might was.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Though I, who enjoy the grace of my&#xA;father Vayu, should not sing my own&#xA;praises, I do so now to end your sorrow.&#xA;Soon the Vanara warriors will be here to&#xA;destroy the Rakshasas and their kingdom.&#xA;I must first return and tell them where you&#xA;are.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And then he described Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;desolation in being parted from Sita, and&#xA;the ascetic life he led, and Sita&amp;rsquo;s heart&#xA;melted in loving sorrow. Sita forgot her&#xA;own suffering thinking of Rama&amp;rsquo;s grief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;DEAR, dear Vanara friend,&amp;rdquo; said Sita,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I do not know whether to rejoice or&#xA;grieve at the news you have brought. Your&#xA;words are like nectar mixed with poison.&#xA;My lord&amp;rsquo;s love for me is sweetest nectar,&#xA;and his grief over my plight is bitterest&#xA;poison.&amp;rdquo; Thus Sita spoke what she felt and&#xA;found comfort in putting in words her love&#xA;and her grief.&#xA;Pleasure and pain, happiness and&#xA;misery alternately impel human beings.&#xA;Sita was consoled but also pained by the&#xA;thought that Rama had not forgotten her,&#xA;but was thinking of her, grieving and&#xA;searching for her.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We are puppets manipulated by the&#xA;twin strings of joy and sorrow&amp;rdquo;, said Sita.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;None of us can escape their pull. My lord&#xA;and Lakshmana and myself are all subject&#xA;to this law. You say my lord suffers like a&#xA;sailing ship caught in a storm on the high&#xA;seas. O! When will he come here? Dear&#xA;Vanara friend, when will he destroy&#xA;Lanka and Ravana and the other&#xA;Rakshasas? All this must take place&#xA;within the two months&amp;rsquo; time still left.&#xA;Please explain this to my lord. Only twomonths remain to me. Vibhishana, the&#xA;younger brother of Ravana, tried his best&#xA;to persuade the latter to change his ways.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Return Sita,&amp;rsquo; he said to Ravana, &amp;lsquo;and save&#xA;Lanka and the Rakshasa race.&amp;rsquo; All his&#xA;words have gone in vain. My heart is&#xA;strong within me. I know Ravana is on the&#xA;road to the abode of Yama. Soon my lord&#xA;will vanquish his foes and redeem me. I&#xA;have no doubt about this. My innocent&#xA;heart tells me this and it cannot prove&#xA;false.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Sita went on speaking with tears&#xA;in her eyes. Hanuman could not bear the&#xA;sight of her suffering.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mother!&amp;rdquo; he exclaimed, &amp;ldquo;I shall go at&#xA;once and bring back Rama. He will&#xA;descend on Lanka with a mighty army.&#xA;But why should you suffer any longer? If&#xA;you are agreeable, sit on my back. I shall&#xA;carry you across the ocean and restore you&#xA;in a moment to Rama. Do not for a&#xA;moment doubt my ability to do this. As&#xA;Agni carries the sacred offerings to Indra,&#xA;so shall I transport you to my Lord Rama.&#xA;Permit me, O pure of heart, to do this&#xA;service. I can not only carry you and&#xA;restore you to Rama, but I have the power&#xA;to wrench Lanka from its foundations and&#xA;throw it and its ruler at Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet! Sit on&#xA;my back now and, like Rohini rejoining&#xA;the Moon, you will rejoin Rama. As I&#xA;sprang and came here, so shall I spring&#xA;and reach the other shore with you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Hanuman went on speaking out&#xA;of his affection and enthusiasm. And Sita&#xA;wondered how the little monkey before&#xA;her could hope to carry her across the&#xA;ocean.&#xA;Hanuman saw her doubt and so, to&#xA;demonstrate his powers, he jumped off&#xA;from the platform and began to grow big&#xA;in size. Sita was pleased.&#xA;But she said: &amp;ldquo;O Son of Vayu! I realise&#xA;your strength and yet it is not right that&#xA;you should carry me. On the way the&#xA;Rakshasas are sure to intercept and&#xA;challenge you. They will hurl their&#xA;weapons at you. Your care will be to&#xA;guard me. You will not be able to fix all&#xA;your mind on the battle and that may be a&#xA;serious set-back to the strongest warrior.&#xA;In a battle, one cannot be certain of&#xA;victory and what would be my fate if you&#xA;should fall? And besides, in the violent&#xA;convulsions of a heady&amp;rsquo; fight, how could I&#xA;be sure of maintaining my position on&#xA;your back? I may slip and fall into the sea.&#xA;It is clear, therefore, that you should not&#xA;try to cross the sea with me. Apart from&#xA;that Hanuman, if you snatch me away&#xA;stealthily from the Rakshasas it would be&#xA;no credit to the valor of my lord. The&#xA;honor of the Kshatriya race demands that&#xA;he should come and fight and vanquish&#xA;Ravana and redeem me as the prize of&#xA;victory. Would Rama have me stolen back&#xA;even as Ravana stole me from him? No,&#xA;my son, return and quickly bring Rama&#xA;here with Lakshmana and the Vanara&#xA;army. Let my lord&amp;rsquo;s arrows destroy Lanka&#xA;and send Ravana to Yama&amp;rsquo;s abode. His&#xA;victory is certain. Like the fierce sun at&#xA;the hour of doom, Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrows will&#xA;burn the Rakshasa people to ashes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You are right,&amp;rdquo; said Hanuman, &amp;ldquo;I shall&#xA;return alone. But what shall I tell Rama?&#xA;What sign shall I carry of my having met&#xA;you and talked with you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing these words, all her happy life&#xA;with Rama came like a flood to her&#xA;memory and her eyes were filled with&#xA;tears. If she told Hanuman and Hanuman&#xA;told Rama some intimate happenings&#xA;known only to herself and her lord, it&#xA;would be proof of Hanuman having seen&#xA;her and also make Rama see her present&#xA;disconsolate state.&#xA;With flowing tears, she recounted&#xA;incidents of their forest life.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Once in Chitrakuta my lord and I&#xA;wandered about in the grove beside theriver and became weary and rested on the&#xA;ground. He laid his head upon my lap and&#xA;fell asleep. While thus, a crow came down&#xA;and hungrily pecked at my bosom, I drove&#xA;it off, but again and again it returned and&#xA;troubled me. I then flung a pebble at it.&#xA;But even that had no effect. Rama was&#xA;roused from slumber and saw me thus&#xA;troubled and weeping in pain. At first&#xA;when he saw what the matter was and&#xA;found it was but a crow, he was inclined&#xA;to laugh at my discomfiture. But he saw&#xA;the bruise the crow had made and&#xA;discovered that the bird was really an&#xA;Asura. The bird flew for its life, but Rama&#xA;sped a dart at it that pursued it wherever it&#xA;went, till at last the crow-Asura sought&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet for refuge and found pardon&#xA;there. Tell him of this incident. O&#xA;Hanuman, I cannot wait for many more&#xA;days. Tell him to come quickly and save&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Again she was in tears as she said: &amp;ldquo;On&#xA;another occasion we were both wandering&#xA;all alone in the forest. I was tired.&#xA;Perspiration had washed off the tilaka on&#xA;my forehead. My lord playfully plucked a&#xA;pinch of red mineral from the rock and&#xA;applied it between my brows with his own&#xA;sweet hands. Ask him if he remembers&#xA;this incident.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As she went on recalling happy&#xA;memories of the past the weight of her&#xA;present sorrow overwhelmed her and she&#xA;wept and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What should I tell Rama? What is&#xA;there that he does not know? Does he&#xA;need my words to rouse his indignation?&#xA;Only tell my lord that I embrace his feet.&#xA;That is enough. There is Lakshmana&#xA;beside him, the brother born to serve him&#xA;and of unrivalled skill in arms. Looking at&#xA;his sweet face, my Lord even forgot his&#xA;grief for the father&amp;rsquo;s death. The pure-&#xA;hearted hero, dear Lakshmana, parted&#xA;from his own mother and came away with&#xA;us and regarded me as his mother. Tell&#xA;him he should come and end my&#xA;suffering.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As she thought of Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;heroism and devoted loyalty, Sita&amp;rsquo;s eyes&#xA;were filled with tears. When Rama had&#xA;gone chasing the golden deer, did she not&#xA;insult him and fling burning words at the&#xA;selfless and devoted friend? The thought&#xA;of this injustice filled her repentant heart&#xA;with insufferable pain.&#xA;She was unwilling to part from&#xA;Hanuman, who had come to her and&#xA;consoled her just as she was about to put&#xA;an end to her life. At the same time, she&#xA;wanted him to return quickly to Rama and&#xA;give him news concerning her.&#xA;At last she said: &amp;ldquo;My child, here is the&#xA;jewel given by my mother at my wedding&#xA;and fixed on my forehead by the late&#xA;Emperor. Take it and give it to my&#xA;husband as a sign from me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying she untied a knot at the&#xA;corner of her sari, took out the divine&#xA;jewel and handed it to Hanuman who&#xA;received it with humble reverence. When&#xA;Hanuman had the jewel in his hand, pride&#xA;and joy filled his mind.&#xA;His heart was far away with Rama.&#xA;Mentally he had recalled Rama&amp;rsquo;s presence&#xA;and conveyed the glad message of his&#xA;discovery. Only his body now stayed in&#xA;Lanka.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear friend,&amp;rdquo; said Sita, &amp;ldquo;you must tell&#xA;Rama all you have learnt here, and it will&#xA;be your good fortune to help him to&#xA;achieve victory.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Hanuman was about to leave, Sita&#xA;spoke again: &amp;ldquo;Dear Hanuman, convey my&#xA;affection to the Prince and also to king&#xA;Sugriva and the other Vanara leaders. Tell&#xA;them from me that I implore them to give&#xA;help to Rama to save me from this sea of&#xA;sorrow. You, more than anyone else, I&#xA;hope will encourage and show the way to&#xA;the prince in all matters.&amp;ldquo;Hanuman answered: &amp;ldquo;Lay aside your&#xA;sorrow, dear princess. Rama, Lakshmana&#xA;and the Vanara army will descend on&#xA;Lanka destroy the Rakshasas and redeem&#xA;you. Have no doubt.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As he was about to go, Sita said again:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Should you not stay here somewhere, for&#xA;a while, and rest? Should you return at&#xA;once? Your visit has given me such great&#xA;consolation and made me forget my grief&#xA;for a while. When you leave, I shall sink&#xA;again in my sea of sorrow. You came here&#xA;crossing the great ocean. How will Rama&#xA;and the big army cross it? Have you&#xA;thought of that?&amp;rdquo; Doubts assailed her once&#xA;again.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Have no doubt, my queen!&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Hanuman. &amp;ldquo;Do you think I am the only&#xA;Vanara that could cross the sea? There is&#xA;not a Vanara but has more power and skill&#xA;than I. Not only Sugriva, but many in his&#xA;army can fly round the world. What is this&#xA;narrow sea to them? There are thousands&#xA;among us who can roam in the sky. Have&#xA;no doubt whatever. Do you think they&#xA;would send the best among them as a&#xA;mere messenger? Dear lady, have done&#xA;with sorrow, for you will soon see me&#xA;with the two mighty princes on my back.&#xA;They will lay waste this city with the&#xA;arrows. They will destroy Ravana and all&#xA;his race. You have as good as crossed the&#xA;ocean of sorrow and reached the other&#xA;shore. God bless you. In a few days you&#xA;will see the two princes standing, bow in&#xA;hand, at the gates of Lanka, destroying the&#xA;Rakshasa host. You will see the Vanara&#xA;army leaping with joy over the ruined&#xA;city. Once they hear the news from me,&#xA;they will not delay a moment. I have only&#xA;to tell them and they will start at once. Do&#xA;not lose heart.&amp;rdquo; Saying this and bowing&#xA;profoundly, Hanuman prepared to go.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Tell Rama and Lakshmana that I am&#xA;alive,&amp;rdquo; cried Sita. &amp;ldquo;See that no time is lost.&#xA;May God bless you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Hanuman left. Let us meditate&#xA;with reverence on the heroic son of&#xA;Anjana, the wise messenger who gave&#xA;consolation to Sita and quenched her&#xA;grief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER taking leave of Sita, Hanuman&#xA;sat for a while on the top of the garden&#xA;wall and began to think:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What can I do to put courage into Sita&#xA;and some fear into Ravana and his friends&#xA;to shake their arrogant confidence? It&#xA;would be good to leave them some&#xA;souvenir of my visit, some indication of&#xA;what the future has in store for them. It is&#xA;clear I must instill some fear into Ravana&#xA;to prevent him from troubling Sita in the&#xA;meantime. Fear is the only argument they&#xA;understand. Ravana has untold wealth and&#xA;one cannot part his friends from him.&#xA;Hence sama (conciliation), dana (buying&#xA;over) and bheda (sowing discord) are&#xA;useless in this case. I should therefore do&#xA;something terrible to frighten them, and&#xA;warn them, not to ill-treat Sita. Yes, I&#xA;must do this before I go away.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At once he began to grow and assumed&#xA;a huge form and began to lay waste the&#xA;grove. Trees fell cracking to the ground,&#xA;bowers collapsed, tanks and artificial hills&#xA;were disfigured and destroyed. The&#xA;beautiful Asoka Park soon became a mass&#xA;of ruin from which the deer and the birds&#xA;fled in fear. The slumbering Rakshasis&#xA;woke up and were bewildered to see this&#xA;unaccountable sight.&#xA;Hanuman sat on the top of the wall of&#xA;the garden, a huge figure of wrathful&#xA;menace, waiting for the answer to his&#xA;challenge. The Rakshasis quaked with&#xA;terror at the sight of this stranger and&#xA;some ran to tell Ravana the news. Some&#xA;approached Sita and asked: &amp;ldquo;How did this&#xA;huge monkey come here? You should&#xA;know who he is. Did he say anything toyou? Tell us the truth. Do not be afraid to&#xA;speak out.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;How do I know what can happen in&#xA;this charmed world of Rakshasas?&amp;rdquo; Sita&#xA;answered, parrying, the question. &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;monkey is probably one of the Rakshasas&#xA;and you are likely to know more about&#xA;him than I.&amp;rdquo; The Rakshasis fled in fear&#xA;from the park and reported to Ravana&#xA;what had happened.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O king! A huge monkey terrible to&#xA;look at has laid waste the royal garden. It&#xA;was in secret talk with Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Of course they omitted to add that they&#xA;had fallen asleep and given a chance for&#xA;Sita to talk to the monkey.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We tried our best to get some&#xA;information from Sita,&amp;rdquo; they added. &amp;ldquo;We&#xA;asked her who he was, and how he came&#xA;there, and what he told her. But she&#xA;refuses to answer. You should seize and&#xA;slay this creature. Do send a strong foe.&#xA;The beautiful grove is completely&#xA;devastated except for the Simsupa tree&#xA;under which Sita is seated. Its spreading&#xA;branches have suffered no damage. The&#xA;monkey which laid waste the tanks and&#xA;bowers has spared the habitation of Sita.&#xA;There must be a reason for this. We&#xA;suspect that this is not an ordinary wild&#xA;animal. It must have been sent by some&#xA;enemy of yours, either Indra or Kubera.&#xA;Or could it have anything to do with&#xA;Rama? How did this monkey dare to talk&#xA;to Sita? He must be a messenger from&#xA;Rama. Do send your warriors to capture&#xA;this terrible beast.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana was furious on hearing that his&#xA;favorite park, set apart for his queens, had&#xA;been destroyed. His eyes glowed like twin&#xA;torches and hot tears rolled down from&#xA;them like drops of burning oil.&#xA;He turned to the bodyguards standing&#xA;beside him ever eager to do his bidding&#xA;and ordered them at once to go and&#xA;destroy the monster-monkey. A strong&#xA;force started to execute the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;commands, armed with maces and spears&#xA;and other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Rakshasa warriors saw with&#xA;amazement a mighty Vanara seated on the&#xA;garden gate, who at their approach grew&#xA;to still bigger size and formidable menace.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh! You have come, have you?&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said and, jumping down, brandished his&#xA;tail, and striking the ground with it, roared&#xA;till the four quarters shook. He snatched&#xA;the huge iron bar from the gate and, armed&#xA;with this weapon, began to attack them&#xA;all.&#xA;He sprang and leaped in all directions&#xA;and, whirling the iron rod, struck the&#xA;Rakshasas down, one by one. After&#xA;finishing them thus, he resumed his seat&#xA;on the top of the pillared entrance, and&#xA;roared once again.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Long&#xA;live&#xA;Rama!&#xA;Long&#xA;live&#xA;Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he&#xA;loudly&#xA;proclaimed.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Long live King Sugriva! Oh! Ye&#xA;Rakshasas of Lanka, your doom are near.&#xA;The great warriors Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;and King Sugriva have sent me here to&#xA;destroy you. Come on in your thousands. I&#xA;stand here ready to hurl you to&#xA;destruction. I have saluted Sita and&#xA;received her blessings. And now I am&#xA;going to destroy your city!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All Lanka heard the thunder of his&#xA;words and quaked in terror. When the&#xA;news reached Ravana that the warriors&#xA;sent against Hanuman were all slain, he&#xA;opened wide his fierce eyes in amazement&#xA;and wrath.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is it you say?&amp;rdquo; he yelled, and&#xA;called Jambumali, the matchless warrior,&#xA;son of Prahasta. And be said to him. &amp;ldquo;Go&#xA;at once! Punish this monkey and report to&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasa Jambumali took some&#xA;time to put on armor and to take up&#xA;weapons and get ready to meet his foe.Meanwhile, Hanuman was not sitting still.&#xA;He climbed to the top of a temple in the&#xA;park and stood there, shining against the&#xA;horizon like a second sun suddenly risen&#xA;in the sky. He magnified his body still&#xA;further and looked like a golden mountain&#xA;range up in the heavens.&#xA;His roar filled the city of Lanka and&#xA;raised echoes from all the eight quarters.&#xA;The hearts of the Rakshasas trembled in&#xA;fear.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Long&#xA;live&#xA;Rama!&#xA;Long&#xA;live&#xA;Lakshmana! Long live King Sugriva! I&#xA;have come as an envoy of the King of&#xA;Kosala. I have come to destroy Lanka. I&#xA;am Hanuman, son of Vayu, come here to&#xA;utterly destroy the enemies of Rama. I&#xA;have vowed before Sita and received her&#xA;blessings. Know that I possess the&#xA;strength to vanquish a thousand Ravanas.&#xA;Big boulders and uprooted trees I shall&#xA;aim at the Rakshasas and destroy them.&#xA;That is what I have come here for!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sentries in the temple took up&#xA;various weapons and attacked him.&#xA;Hanuman jumped down and plucked up a&#xA;big pillar, supporting the temple, and&#xA;stood there like the destroyer. Whirling&#xA;his massive weapon easily as though it&#xA;was a willow wand, Hanuman struck&#xA;down and slew the sentries. The temple,&#xA;from which the pillar had been removed,&#xA;collapsed. As Hanuman struck the ground&#xA;with the pillar, sparks of fire flew all&#xA;around.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;In Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s army there are monkeys&#xA;much mightier than I and they will soon&#xA;be here,&amp;rdquo; he roared. &amp;ldquo;You and your king&#xA;and your city will be destroyed by them,&#xA;root and branch. Your king has incurred&#xA;the enmity of the Lord of the Ikshvaku&#xA;race, has he not? Lanka is nearing its end.&#xA;Destruction awaits the Rakshasas. The&#xA;God of Death is approaching Ravana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jambumali arrived at last. With wide,&#xA;glaring eyes and ugly, irregular teeth&#xA;dressed in scarlet, with large golden rings&#xA;in his ears, bow in hand, garland round his&#xA;neck, sword at his hip, he came in a&#xA;chariot rattling like thunder. Hanuman set&#xA;eyes on the chariot dragged by enormous&#xA;mules. And he got ready.&#xA;Seated in his chariot, Jambumali bent&#xA;his bow and aimed a few arrows at Maruti&#xA;who was seated on the wall. They&#xA;wounded his face and drew blood, which&#xA;added to the beauty of his face. It was as if&#xA;a red lotus had suddenly blossomed in the&#xA;heavens. The wounds enraged Hanuman,&#xA;who picked up a big boulder and flung it&#xA;at the chariot.&#xA;He uprooted a sal tree and, twirling it,&#xA;flung it at Jambumali. Then he plucked&#xA;out a huge iron rod from the temple and&#xA;aimed it at the chariot and reduced it to&#xA;splinters and crushed the huge body of&#xA;Jambumali into a shapeless mass, in&#xA;which neither head nor limbs could be&#xA;distinguished.&#xA;The issue of this battle was duly&#xA;reported to Ravana. He was struck with&#xA;wonder. &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;This is indeed something&#xA;strange,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself. &amp;ldquo;This&#xA;murderous brute is not an animal,&#xA;certainly not a mere monkey. It is some&#xA;new creature devised by my old enemies&#xA;the gods to annoy me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And be ordered mighty commanders to&#xA;go with a great army to capture the&#xA;creature and produce it before him.&#xA;The Rakshasa chiefs went forth in a&#xA;great array of chariots. In full force they&#xA;attacked Hanuman, who was as before&#xA;stationed on top of the entrance and was&#xA;laughing aloud in disdainful unconcern.&#xA;They showered missiles on him that&#xA;mostly glanced harmlessly off his&#xA;adamantine frame. With each dart or&#xA;arrow that struck him, he grew in stature&#xA;and fierceness. And ranging all round with&#xA;energy pelted them with rocks and huge&#xA;tree boles, till all the leaders lay crushedand slain, and the survivors fled in panic&#xA;and despair.&#xA;Having killed or put to fight the entire&#xA;contingent of Rakshasas, Hanuman roared&#xA;in triumph and Lanka trembled at the roar.&#xA;He resumed his seat on the stone-&#xA;battlement on the top of the garden-gate.&#xA;Hearing of the defeat of the force sent to&#xA;capture Hanuman and the slaughter of five&#xA;of his best commanders, fear for the first&#xA;time entered Ravana&amp;rsquo;s heart. &amp;ldquo;It is&#xA;extraordinary that a solitary monkey&#xA;should have this devastating valor and&#xA;purposeful malevolence,&amp;rdquo; Ravana thought&#xA;with anxiety. &amp;ldquo;This is clearly a conspiracy&#xA;of the gods.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But he kept his concern to himself and&#xA;laughed derisively. He looked round at all&#xA;the members of his great council. His son&#xA;the heroic Aksha stood foremost, eager for&#xA;battle, and the proud father bade him go&#xA;forth to battle against the tremendous foe.&#xA;Radiant with youth and health and&#xA;glowing with high courage at this&#xA;opportunity of distinguishing himself,&#xA;Aksha went forth in a shining chariot,&#xA;confident of victory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VALMIKI describes in beautiful verses&#xA;how the youthful warrior Aksha, the equal&#xA;of the gods, rode to battle in a chariot&#xA;drawn by eight horses.&#xA;Who can put up in a different tongue&#xA;Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s poetry describing the beauty of&#xA;forests and the terrible fury of encounters&#xA;between warriors? The rhythm and&#xA;grandeur of his words convey the terror&#xA;and majesty of what he describes. This&#xA;power is Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s special gift. We can&#xA;only summarise in pedestrian prose his&#xA;glowing account, of the battle between&#xA;Aksha, the beloved son of Ravana, and&#xA;Hanuman.&#xA;In a golden chariot acquired through&#xA;tapasya rode Ravana&amp;rsquo;s young son. When&#xA;he saw Hanuman, seated on the stone&#xA;battlement above the gateway, and noted&#xA;approvingly the beautiful symmetry of his&#xA;mighty limbs, and the majestic intrepidity&#xA;of his look, Aksha felt that here was a foe&#xA;worthy of his steel. He summoned all his&#xA;strength and resolution to do him honor.&#xA;The young warrior aimed three sharp&#xA;arrows at Hanuman. They struck his body&#xA;and drew blood. But Maruti&amp;rsquo;s strength&#xA;increased and his face shone with new&#xA;splendor. He too was pleased with the&#xA;prowess of the youthful Rakshasa.&#xA;Fierce grew the battle between the two.&#xA;Hundreds of arrows rose in clouds into the&#xA;sky and hit Maruti. Like rain falling on a&#xA;rock, they fell on Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s body. Rising&#xA;in the air Hanuman dodged about evading&#xA;the arrows. Slipping as it were through the&#xA;meshes of that deadly network of missiles&#xA;and finding a favorable opening closed&#xA;with Aksha.&#xA;Hanuman admired Aksha&amp;rsquo;s youthful&#xA;promise and heroism, and was sorry to&#xA;have to slay him, but there was no help for&#xA;it for the prince seemed to get more and&#xA;more formidable as the fight went on. And&#xA;it was unwise to take chances with him.&#xA;At last Hanuman hardened his heart and&#xA;decided to destroy the youth.&#xA;He rushed against Aksha&amp;rsquo;s chariot and&#xA;broke it to pieces. The horses fell dead.&#xA;The Rakshasa prince stood on the ground&#xA;chariotless. Nothing daunted, he rose in&#xA;the air with bow and sword and attacked&#xA;Hanuman. A great battle took place in the&#xA;air. In the end Aksha&amp;rsquo;s bones were crushed&#xA;and splintered and he fell down dead.&#xA;Hearing that the prince had been killed&#xA;by Hanuman, Ravana shook with rage, but&#xA;controlling himself he called his son&#xA;Indrajit, the conqueror of Indra.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have mastered all weapons,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said. &amp;ldquo;You have vanquished the Devas and&#xA;Asuras in battle. You have by your&#xA;austerities called Brahma down and&#xA;secured from him the Brahmastra. Thereis none in the world who can oppose you.&#xA;Fatigue cannot approach you. Your&#xA;knowledge of battle is unique. You have&#xA;attained strength through tapasya. Nothing&#xA;is impossible for you. None can equal&#xA;you in foresight. The Kinneras I sent and&#xA;Jambumali and the five generals of our&#xA;army, and your dear brother Aksha have&#xA;all been slain by a terrible foe who has&#xA;raided us in the form of a monkey and it is&#xA;yours now to avenge them. Do not&#xA;underrate him. It seems he cannot be&#xA;vanquished by weapons. He cannot be&#xA;brought down in wrestling. Consider well&#xA;therefore what needs to be done. Do it and&#xA;return victorious. The astras you have&#xA;secured through tapasya can serve you at&#xA;this moment.&#xA;Without allowing your&#xA;mind to wander, fight with concentration&#xA;and return triumphant.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Indrajit, bright like the gods, accepted&#xA;his father&amp;rsquo;s command with reverence and&#xA;receiving his blessings went with courage&#xA;and eagerness towards the Asoka Vana.&#xA;Standing in a chariot drawn by four&#xA;fierce lions and twanging his bowstring,&#xA;Indrajit proceeded towards Hanuman. His&#xA;chariot sounded like the wind off the&#xA;monsoon. His lotus-like eyes shone&#xA;victory.&#xA;As Hanuman saw the chariot coming&#xA;towards him, he was filled with joy.&#xA;Indrajit too, skilful in battle, bent his bow&#xA;and got his sharp arrows ready for&#xA;Hanuman. Knowing that a great battle was&#xA;at band, the Nagas, Yakshas and Siddhas&#xA;assembled in the sky to see.&#xA;At the sight of Indrajit Hanuman roared&#xA;and increased his stature still further.&#xA;Silently the Rakshasa warrior dispatched&#xA;his darts. Showers of arrows began to&#xA;descend as in the battle of the gods and&#xA;their cousins, the Asuras. Hanuman rose&#xA;in the sky and, moving with speed like&#xA;lightning, struck down the sharp arrows.&#xA;His roar made the quarters echo, drowning&#xA;the drumbeats and the bow-twangs of the&#xA;Rakshasa.&#xA;The battle raged with increasing fury&#xA;and filled all beholders with amazement.&#xA;In skill and strength the two warriors were&#xA;perfect equals. No matter how often he&#xA;was&#xA;wounded,&#xA;Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;strength&#xA;showed no signs of lessening. Indrajit&#xA;therefore resolved: &amp;ldquo;My arrows cannot&#xA;vanquish this monkey. What my father&#xA;said is true. He can be bound only by&#xA;using the Brahmastra.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasa Prince sent forth the&#xA;Brahmastra. At its touch the Vanara&#xA;warrior lay bound and helpless. Hanuman&#xA;realised what had happened. He said to&#xA;himself: &amp;ldquo;I have been bound by the&#xA;Brahmastra.&amp;rdquo; Hanuman too had secured a&#xA;boon from Brahma, and this he now&#xA;remembered.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This will keep me bound for only one&#xA;muhoorta (four fifths of an hour),&amp;rdquo; he said&#xA;to himself. &amp;ldquo;I run no real risk. Let me see&#xA;what the Rakshasas do to me while I lie&#xA;bound and helpless. I might find here a&#xA;further opportunity to function as a&#xA;messenger.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As instructed by Brahma when he gave&#xA;him the gift of immortality, he&#xA;surrendered himself to the Brahmastra and&#xA;lay down on the ground, inactive but in&#xA;full possession of his faculties.&#xA;When they saw Hanuman thus lying&#xA;helpless on the ground the Rakshasas who&#xA;till then stood at a distance in fear,&#xA;surrounded him and danced with joy and&#xA;called him insulting names and praised&#xA;their prince.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We shall cut you to pieces!&amp;rdquo; they&#xA;shouted. &amp;ldquo;Let us eat him up. We shall drag&#xA;him to the throne of our Ravana.&amp;rdquo; Thus&#xA;and in many other ways they shouted.&#xA;A few among them feared and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This fellow is only pretending. He may&#xA;get up suddenly and attack us.&amp;rdquo; So they&#xA;brought ropes of jute and coconut fibberand bound him hard and shouted&#xA;exultingly: &amp;ldquo;Now we have bound him, let&#xA;us drag him to the Lord of the Rakshasas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Indrajit, who discovered too late and&#xA;could not prevent this foolish mistake of&#xA;the Rakshasas, felt sad.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas!&amp;rdquo; he thought with sorrow. &amp;ldquo;They&#xA;have undone all my work. These fools do&#xA;not know the secrets of supernatural&#xA;weapons. When they have thus used ropes&#xA;and jute for binding him, the astra&#xA;withdraws its power. The bound of the&#xA;mantra is undone when physical bonds are&#xA;added. Hanuman is now held only by the&#xA;ropes that he can burst asunder and the&#xA;Brahmastra cannot be used a second&#xA;time.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman too understood this, and&#xA;knew he could spring up free if he liked.&#xA;But he welcomed the opportunity to meet&#xA;and talk to Ravana and allowed himself to&#xA;be dragged to the king, patiently bearing&#xA;all their insults and cruelties in seeming&#xA;helplessness.&#xA;They belabored and foully&#xA;abused him, and dragged him through the&#xA;streets and women and children came out&#xA;to look at him and jeer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>57 LANKA IN FLAMES</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;His captors took him to the court of&#xA;Ravana and placed him in front of the&#xA;King. Forgetting the pain and insults he&#xA;had borne, Hanuman gazed with wrathful&#xA;curiosity at the giant monarch. As he&#xA;gazed at him resplendent on his throne a&#xA;sort of pitying admiration of the doomed&#xA;Rakshasa entered his thoughts.&#xA;Clad in silk of golden hue, with the&#xA;royal crown on his head, the jewels inlaid&#xA;in it shining brilliantly, Ravana sat there, a&#xA;figure of dazzling splendor. The whole&#xA;court was brilliant with shining gold and&#xA;gems, pearls and silk. His dark body, lit&#xA;up by the marks of royalty, looked like a&#xA;great radiant hill.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas!&amp;rdquo; thought Hanuman full of anger,&#xA;wonder and pity. &amp;ldquo;If only this great one&#xA;had not swerved from the path of dharma,&#xA;not even Indra could equal him. What a&#xA;form, what radiance, what strength!&#xA;Trusting to the boon he had secured, he&#xA;took to wicked ways and has lost his&#xA;happiness and forfeited his greatness.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As Hanuman was lost in thought thus,&#xA;Ravana addressed his ministers: &amp;ldquo;Find out&#xA;from this wicked fellow who he is, where&#xA;he has come from, who has sent him here&#xA;and why he entered Lanka. Tell him to&#xA;speak truthfully.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As ordered by the king, Prahasta&#xA;questioned Hanuman. &amp;ldquo;Do not be afraid,&#xA;monkey! If you speak the truth, you will&#xA;escape punishment. Did Indra send you&#xA;here? Or are you Kubera&amp;rsquo;s servant? Whose&#xA;orders are you carrying out? Speak the&#xA;truth and save yourself. Why have you&#xA;come here thus disguised? Take care you&#xA;hide nothing!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman, facing Ravana directly, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Neither Indra, nor Kubera has sent me&#xA;here. I am a Vanara. I came here to have a&#xA;look at the Rakshasa king. That was why I&#xA;laid waste the garden. Otherwise I could&#xA;not get to the king&amp;rsquo;s presence. And&#xA;because they attacked me and tried to kill&#xA;me, I killed them in self-defence. I have&#xA;come here as the messenger of Sugriva,&#xA;the Vanara king. O Rakshasa king my lord&#xA;looks on you as a brother and sends you&#xA;his greetings. Ramachandra, the famous&#xA;son of king Dasaratha of Ayodhya, has&#xA;become a friend of Sugriva and slaying&#xA;Vali has made Sugriva king. When&#xA;Ramachandra, heir to the throne of&#xA;Ayodhya, was living in the Dandaka&#xA;forest to fulfil his father&amp;rsquo;s word, his&#xA;consort who had been left alone for a&#xA;while was lost and at the behest of Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana, Sugriva has sent his&#xA;servant to look for her throughout the&#xA;world. I came to Lanka on this search and&#xA;here I saw the good princess. O lord of the&#xA;Rakshasas, I speak to you with the respectdue from the messenger of a brother king.&#xA;I speak to you also as a devoted servant of&#xA;the Prince of Ayodhya. You know well it&#xA;was a cowardly act and totally contrary to&#xA;dharma to carry off the princess Sita. This&#xA;is sure to end in the destruction of your&#xA;race if you persist in your wicked folly.&#xA;Restore Sita to the prince and seek his&#xA;forgiveness. Know that Death has come to&#xA;you in the form of Sita. Do not mistake&#xA;poison for food. It is not wisdom to&#xA;oppose dharma and run into deadly&#xA;danger. You know well enough that the&#xA;sin of desiring another&amp;rsquo;s wife will&#xA;consume utterly the merit you have earned&#xA;through tapas and destroy you inevitably.&#xA;Your only recourse now is to seek refuge&#xA;at Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet. Do not make Rama your&#xA;enemy and bring about your own&#xA;destruction. The boons you have secured&#xA;will avail you nothing against the Prince&#xA;of the Raghu race. Consider well and&#xA;realise the danger you are in. Pay heed to&#xA;the words of this humble messenger of the&#xA;Vanara king. Turn to the right path and&#xA;find safety. These words from a brother&#xA;king are true and meant for your welfare.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman uttered this bitter warning in&#xA;a loud and clear voice. When the&#xA;Rakshasa king heard it, his eyes grew red&#xA;with anger, and he ordered that Hanuman&#xA;should be killed forthwith.&#xA;But&#xA;Vibhishana pointed out that it would be&#xA;improper to kill a king&amp;rsquo;s envoy.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;According to the law of kings it is not&#xA;permitted on any account to kill envoys&#xA;and messengers. You can have him&#xA;mutilated, whipped or branded, but not&#xA;killed,&amp;rdquo; so counselled Vibhishana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is wrong,&amp;rdquo; asked Ravana, &amp;ldquo;in&#xA;killing one who has sinned so greatly?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Answered&#xA;Vibhishana&#xA;with&#xA;due&#xA;politeness: &amp;ldquo;No matter how grievous his&#xA;offence, it was done at the bidding of&#xA;others. To leave his royal masters alone&#xA;and to slay their instrument, a mere&#xA;messenger, what use or sense is there in&#xA;it? Let us by all means seek ways of&#xA;punishing those that sent him here. They&#xA;must be brought here and given due&#xA;punishment. If he is slain now, what&#xA;chance is there of our real enemies being&#xA;brought here? If, on the other hand, he is&#xA;sent back alive to them, they will come&#xA;here and attack us. Then they will receive&#xA;proper punishment at your hands.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana agreed. &amp;ldquo;Very well,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;a&#xA;monkey&amp;rsquo;s most cherished possession is his&#xA;tail. Set fire to his tail, flog him soundly&#xA;and turn him out.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At these words of the Rakshasa king,&#xA;his servants took Hanuman out. They&#xA;wrapped his tail in rags of all kinds. His&#xA;tail grew in size and, as it grew, they&#xA;brought more and more old rags and&#xA;wrapped them round. They soaked the&#xA;whole in oil and set it ablaze like a huge&#xA;flaming torch.&#xA;Thus bound by ropes and with tail&#xA;ablaze, Hanuman was taken through the&#xA;streets of Lanka.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Here goes the thief that entered our&#xA;city!&amp;rdquo; cried the women and children. They&#xA;jeered at him as he was taken round by the&#xA;exulting Rakshasas to the accompaniment&#xA;of pipes and drums through all the&#xA;highways and byways of Lanka.&#xA;In the Asoka Vana the Rakshasis told&#xA;Sita: &amp;ldquo;The monkey with whom you had&#xA;secret talk, do you know what has&#xA;happened to him? They have wrapped his&#xA;tail in cloth soaked in oil and have set fire&#xA;to it. His tail is ablaze. They are taking&#xA;him in procession through the town.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They told Sita the tale and laughed in&#xA;scorn. She kindled a fire and offered a&#xA;prayer to the god of Fire: &amp;ldquo;O Agni! If&#xA;there be any goodness in me, any purity,&#xA;be cool to Hanuman; do not hurt him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman endured the blows and the&#xA;insults heaped upon him, and proceeded&#xA;from street to street quietly observingeverything.&#xA;The Rakshasas, to amuse&#xA;their women and children took him&#xA;through all the streets and bylanes of the&#xA;city. And he noted in silence, for future,&#xA;use all the secrets of that fortified city.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;But what is this miracle?&amp;rdquo; he thought.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The rags soaked in oil burn brightly but&#xA;the fire does not hurt and is cool on my&#xA;tail. The elements themselves seem kind&#xA;to one engaged in Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose. Did&#xA;not the mountain rise above the sea and&#xA;offer me hospitality? Even so the god of&#xA;Fire is gracious to me now and does not&#xA;harm me. Or may be, Agni being a friend&#xA;of my father Vayu, is gentle with me.&#xA;Now, I think I should not let slip this&#xA;opportunity which has come to me&#xA;unsought to put the fear of God into these&#xA;Rakshasas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Suddenly he shrank in size and shook&#xA;off the ropes that bound him and,&#xA;resuming his huge shape, jumped with his&#xA;blazing tail to the top of a tall building. He&#xA;plucked a pillar there and whirled it&#xA;round, striking terror in all beholders.&#xA;Then he jumped from mansion to&#xA;mansion, setting fire to them. In a little&#xA;while a strong breeze began to blow and&#xA;the whole city was in flames. The&#xA;Rakshasas and their women and children&#xA;shouted in terror and ran hither and&#xA;thither.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This monkey is no other than Yama,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said some. &amp;ldquo;No, he must be the god Agni,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said others. And they all fled from their&#xA;burning houses.&#xA;Recalling the insults he had suffered,&#xA;Hanuman was pleased when he saw the&#xA;flames rise. He sat on the summit of the&#xA;Trikuta hill and contemplated with&#xA;satisfaction the red glow of the burning&#xA;city.&#xA;Then he went to the sea and,&#xA;plunging in, put out the fire in his tail and&#xA;came ashore.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas! Alas! What have I done?&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said with uncontrollable grief. &amp;ldquo;I have lost&#xA;my senses in my rage. What is the use of&#xA;strength and skill and all other gifts if one&#xA;cannot control one&amp;rsquo;s anger? Sita too must&#xA;have perished in this great conflagration I&#xA;have raised. My angry deed has led to the&#xA;utter ruin of my whole purpose. Alas,&#xA;there is no fool, no sinner, like me on&#xA;earth. My rage against the Rakshasas has&#xA;ended in the death of Sita. Here and now I&#xA;must put an end to my life and to my&#xA;shame!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then he heard some voices in the sky.&#xA;The Charanas and Yakshas were rejoicing&#xA;and saying, &amp;ldquo;What a miracle! Glory be to&#xA;Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s prowess! Except the spot&#xA;where Sita is, all Lanka is in flames!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing this ethereal conversation,&#xA;Hanuman was relieved. &amp;ldquo;Sita has saved&#xA;herself. She saved me, for it was her&#xA;purity and power that kept the fire from&#xA;harming me. How can fire help paying&#xA;homage to the goddess of chastity? What&#xA;can fire do to fire? This fire that I started&#xA;could not go near Sita. And is not all this&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose? Did not the ocean king&#xA;and Mynaka Mountain come to my help?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thinking thus, Hanuman went straight&#xA;to the Asoka Park again. There, under the&#xA;Simsupa tree, he saw Sita who was greatly&#xA;relieved to see him alive and cheerful.&#xA;Rejoicing, he bowed before her and&#xA;said, &amp;ldquo;Oh mother! I have seen you safe&#xA;and sound. This is your power and my&#xA;good fortune. Now give me leave to go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Sita said, &amp;ldquo;You are indeed a hero.&#xA;For you there is nothing impossible. See&#xA;that my lord comes here soon and lays&#xA;low the Rakshasas and redeems me. I&#xA;depend on you. You alone can achieve&#xA;this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Be assured,&amp;rdquo; said Hanuman. &amp;ldquo;Sugriva&#xA;will soon be here with Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana and the myriads of Vanaras.&#xA;Ravana and his wicked hordes will perish.&#xA;The happy prince will return with you toAyodhya. Grieve no more. God bless&#xA;you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus consoling her, Hanuman took&#xA;leave of Sita. He went to the shore of the&#xA;sea and, climbing up the beautiful hill&#xA;called Arishta, rose into the sky.&#xA;On the way he saw Mynaka eagerly&#xA;awaiting him. He affectionately stroked it&#xA;with his hand, but did not stop. He flew&#xA;straight like an arrow shot from a bow. At&#xA;the sight of Mahendra hill he knew that he&#xA;was near the other shore and he roared.&#xA;The Vanaras, meanwhile, who saw&#xA;Hanuman flying towards them like a great&#xA;eagle across the sky, shouted: &amp;ldquo;He is&#xA;come. He is come!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Till now their hearts had been full of&#xA;care and their eyes wet. Now they jumped&#xA;in their joy.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It is certain he is returning in&#xA;triumph,&amp;rdquo; said Jambavan. &amp;ldquo;Else he would&#xA;not roar in this manner.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;They climbed up trees and hills and&#xA;stood watching with joy the approach of&#xA;Hanuman returning from Lanka.&#xA;And Hanuman rejoiced to see the&#xA;mountains and trees all covered with his&#xA;friends. Amid their glad uproar, he&#xA;alighted on the Mahendra hill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BESIDE themselves with joy at the&#xA;sight of Hanuman, the Vanaras assembled&#xA;on the Mahendra peak. And the veteran&#xA;Jambavan welcoming the son of Vayu&#xA;with great affection, spoke on behalf of&#xA;all.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We are eager to hear a full account of&#xA;your&#xA;journey&#xA;and&#xA;its&#xA;triumphant&#xA;conclusion. More particularly, we are&#xA;anxious to know how you discovered Sita.&#xA;How is she now? What is the state of her&#xA;mind and body? And dear son of Anjana,&#xA;tell us about Ravana&amp;rsquo;s state and behavior.&#xA;After knowing everything we shall be in a&#xA;position to consider and decide what&#xA;needs to be done next. &amp;quot;&#xA;Hanuman tendered mental salutations&#xA;to Sita and began his story.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You know how I sprang into the sky&#xA;from this peak. As I was flying over the&#xA;sea, a golden mountain rose suddenly&#xA;above the surface of the water. I thought it&#xA;was something rising up to obstruct me&#xA;and I gave it a flick with my tail. Meekly&#xA;receiving the blow, the mountain said in a&#xA;sweet voice: &amp;lsquo;My son, I am no enemy. I&#xA;was saved by your father from the dire&#xA;wrath of Indra and am ever greateful to&#xA;him. I now live in safety sheltered by the&#xA;sea. In olden days, we mountains had&#xA;wings and flew hither and thither in the&#xA;sky and the world was in dread of us.&#xA;Then Indra, to rid the world of this terror,&#xA;relentlessly pursued us and cut off our&#xA;wings. It was from this common fate that&#xA;your father rescued me. You are engaged&#xA;in the most fatiguing task of flying across&#xA;the sea. I have come up here to offer you&#xA;some rest. Stay here for a while and then&#xA;fulfil Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose.&amp;rsquo; I declined the offer&#xA;for lack of time and, taking leave of him,&#xA;went on my way.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus, in proper sequence and without&#xA;omission, Hanuman recounted all that&#xA;happened during the passage and in the&#xA;city of Lanka. He told them how he&#xA;searched for Sita in vain in Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;palace, how he found her at last in the&#xA;Asoka Vana, how Ravana sought and&#xA;importuned her and was spurned by her.&#xA;He narrated what dire threats Ravana held&#xA;out, how the Rakshasis teased her and&#xA;drove her to think of putting an end to her&#xA;own life, and how it was at this juncture&#xA;that he approached and gave her news of&#xA;Rama and hope and interest in life.&#xA;With tears in his eyes he told them&#xA;what a divinely precious soul Sita was and&#xA;how nobly she had borne herself. Then he&#xA;narrated how he destroyed the park and&#xA;killed the Rakshasa warriors, how he was&#xA;finally bound by Indrajit and producedbefore Ravana. He described what took&#xA;place at the interview, and how as a&#xA;punishment for his boldness of speech&#xA;they set fire to his tail, furnishing him&#xA;thereby with a great torch with which he&#xA;set their city ablaze.&#xA;On such occasions, when a character&#xA;has to recapitulate past events, we can see&#xA;Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s skill in retelling the story in&#xA;beautiful words. This is a source of&#xA;special pleasure to those who read the&#xA;Ramayana as a religious exercise. They do&#xA;not dislike such repetitions. Indeed it is&#xA;one of the special charms in a large epic.&#xA;But I have abridged the recital to suit the&#xA;general reader who has no time or taste&#xA;for an oft-repeated tale however edifying.&#xA;Those who wish to avert some calamity or&#xA;desire success in some great undertaking&#xA;usually make a Parayana (devotional&#xA;reading exercise) of the whole of the&#xA;Sundarakanda, the canto dealing with&#xA;Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s expedition to Lanka. It is&#xA;believed that the same result can be&#xA;obtained even by a Parayana of only this&#xA;chapter where Hanuman relates to the&#xA;Vanara warriors all that happened&#xA;between his crossing and recrossing the&#xA;sea.&#xA;After this full narration of the&#xA;happenings, Hanuman proceeded: &amp;ldquo;Our&#xA;efforts have been successful so far&#xA;because of the power of chastity of Sita&#xA;who is chastity incarnate. When I think of&#xA;her I wonder how the Rakshasa could&#xA;seize and carry her away and yet escape&#xA;being burnt to ashes. But Ravana too had&#xA;accumulated great power through his&#xA;tapas. Even so, Sita could have reduced&#xA;him to ashes if she had chosen, but she&#xA;patiently endured all this, because she&#xA;wanted the punishment to proceed from&#xA;her lord. And now what is your advice?&#xA;Shall we go straight to Lanka, destroy&#xA;Ravana and the Rakshasa hordes, recover&#xA;Sita and restore her to Rama? It is not as if&#xA;we have not the strength to do this.&#xA;Single-handed I can destroy them and&#xA;leave not a trace behind. And Jambavan&#xA;too, all by himself, can utterly destroy the&#xA;Rakshasas. And so can our Prince&#xA;Angada; and so can Panasa or Nila; so can&#xA;Mainda and Dwivida, the sons of Asvini.&#xA;Yes, there are many among us who can&#xA;slay Ravana and the Rakshasa hordes.&#xA;Indeed I proclaimed aloud in Lanka: &amp;lsquo;I, the&#xA;messenger of Rama and the minister of&#xA;Sugriva, am come to destroy you.&amp;rsquo; But&#xA;while we are talking, Vaidehi, the&#xA;Goddess of purity, is there under the&#xA;Simsupa tree a closely guarded prisoner&#xA;pining with aching heart for rescue. In her&#xA;hour of despair, I showed myself to her,&#xA;and comforted her with the assurance of&#xA;her lord&amp;rsquo;s speedy arrival. Consider well&#xA;and decide what should now be done.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Angada, listening to all this, full of&#xA;indignation jumped up, saying: &amp;ldquo;I can do&#xA;it all alone. And there are so many of us&#xA;here, eager warriors thirsting for battle. It&#xA;would be improper, after all these days, to&#xA;go to Rama empty-handed and without&#xA;Sita. Let us go straight to Lanka, destroy&#xA;Ravana and the Rakshasa army and return&#xA;to Kishkindha with Sita in our midst.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jambavan, old and wise, uttered a&#xA;gentle protest. &amp;ldquo;No, it is not right, dear&#xA;prince,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We should report&#xA;everything to Rama and Lakshmana and&#xA;then do what they desire. Rama&amp;rsquo;s purpose&#xA;should be fulfilled in the manner that he&#xA;desires. That alone is proper.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All the Vanaras, including Hanuman&#xA;and Angada, agreed that this was the right&#xA;thing to do. They then rose into the sky&#xA;and flew towards Kishkindha.&#xA;They alighted near the protected park&#xA;of the Vanara king. They made their way&#xA;into it, drank honey and ate fruit,&#xA;regardless of the warnings of the guards.&#xA;They indulged in unrestrained revelry and&#xA;ruined the beautiful park.Unable to stand the riotous behavior of&#xA;the mirth-makers, Dadhimukha, Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;uncle and keeper of the royal park, hurried&#xA;to the king and complained.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your protected park has been laid&#xA;waste. The Vanaras that went south have&#xA;returned and, alighting in the garden, are&#xA;behaving outrageously. They pay no heed&#xA;to my words. On the contrary, they&#xA;assaulted and insulted me. They drank up&#xA;and ruined all the honeycombs and&#xA;plucked and ate fruit as they liked and are&#xA;now lying senseless as a result of their&#xA;revelry. The trees and plants are all in&#xA;ruins. The king should forthwith inflict&#xA;suitable&#xA;punishment&#xA;on&#xA;these&#xA;undisciplined Vanaras.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva understood the position at&#xA;once. &amp;ldquo;Lakshmana, it is clear that&#xA;Hanuman, Jambavan and Angada have&#xA;succeeded in their search and are&#xA;celebrating their triumph in this manner.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this he turned to Dadhimukha and&#xA;said to him: &amp;ldquo;Send them all here at once.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dadhimukha now understood the real&#xA;state of affairs and, hastening to the&#xA;Vanaras, conveyed to them the king&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;command.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUGRIVA&amp;rsquo;S conjecture was like nectar&#xA;to Rama&amp;rsquo;s ears. They eagerly awaited the&#xA;arrival of the Vanaras. In a short while a&#xA;great clamor was in the air and the Vanara&#xA;hordes alighted with cries of triumph.&#xA;Hanuman and Angada leading, the&#xA;Vanaras marched to the presence of their&#xA;king who with Rama and Lakshmana was&#xA;awaiting their coming.&#xA;Hanuman bowed and said: &amp;ldquo;Seen have&#xA;I the Goddess of purity, your queen. She&#xA;is safe and well in Lanka. I salute her&#xA;from here across space.&amp;rdquo; And he turned&#xA;southwards&#xA;and&#xA;offered&#xA;worshipful&#xA;salutation.&#xA;Thus succinctly did Hanuman convey&#xA;to the prince the glad news that Sita was&#xA;found and was well in body and mind.&#xA;Sugriva&#xA;and&#xA;Lakshmana,&#xA;beside&#xA;themselves with joy, embraced Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear Vanara friends,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed the&#xA;Prince of Ayodhya, &amp;ldquo;tell me where exactly&#xA;Sita is. How is she? How did you manage&#xA;to see her? Tell me everything in detail.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;His eager inquiries came quick upon one&#xA;another.&#xA;The other Vanaras turned to Hanuman&#xA;who stood behind, and asked him to&#xA;narrate all that he had seen and done.&#xA;Hanuman began to tell the tale. With his&#xA;unrivalled courage and strength and&#xA;single-handed, he had performed a mighty&#xA;task. Yet he did not push himself forward&#xA;into the presence of Prince Rama or King&#xA;Sugriva, but gave precedence to Angada&#xA;and the aged Jambavan and the others,&#xA;and was silent until they asked him to&#xA;speak.&#xA;Indeed, generally, great men who dare&#xA;and do mighty deeds are disinclined to&#xA;speak about their exploits. In painting this&#xA;scene the poet brings out this law of&#xA;natural conduct. Another thing to note&#xA;here is Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s reverence for Sita.&#xA;From the time he first saw her, his&#xA;reverence for Sita appeared to surpass&#xA;even his devotion to Rama, if the two&#xA;could be distinguished. This is the case&#xA;with all pious devotees who regard and&#xA;worship the Supreme as Mother. When&#xA;that aspect of the All immanent Power is&#xA;before true devotees, their reverence&#xA;becomes ecstatic like the child&amp;rsquo;s joy in the&#xA;mother&amp;rsquo;s lap.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Crossing the hundred yojanas of&#xA;water, I reached the city of the wicked&#xA;Ravana on the southern shore. There, in a&#xA;park attached to the palace, I saw Sita held&#xA;prisoner and closely guarded. It was&#xA;wonderful to see her emaciated form. She&#xA;maintained life only in the thought of her&#xA;lord and repetition of his name. Cruel and&#xA;ugly Rakshasis surrounded her. I saw herlying on the ground, her hair unkempt and&#xA;her face clouded by sorrow and care.&#xA;When I reached there, she had resolved to&#xA;put an end to her life to escape from the&#xA;Rakshasa king&amp;rsquo;s importunities and threats.&#xA;I began uttering praises of your glory in a&#xA;low voice. Unknown to her, and a mere&#xA;monkey, I had to secure her confidence&#xA;first. Then I spoke to her. I told her of the&#xA;alliance between King Sugriva and&#xA;yourself. I told her of your great grief and&#xA;unchanging love. This filled her with&#xA;sweet sorrow and awakened hope in her&#xA;and the desire to live. Asked for a token&#xA;which I might convey to you, the angel of&#xA;purity gave me this jewel to be given to&#xA;you. She also told me how once a crow&#xA;had troubled her while you were asleep&#xA;and how you were grieved about it, she&#xA;asked me to remind you of the incident.&#xA;She wanted me to remind you of another&#xA;occasion when, roaming among the hills,&#xA;perspiration had made the tilak trickle&#xA;down her forehead and you replaced it&#xA;with red ochre rubbed out of a rock. She&#xA;bade me tell you that she would struggle&#xA;and keep alive for a month, but then she&#xA;would perish at the hands of Ravana, or&#xA;she would seek her own release of death.&#xA;She bade me convey her respects to the&#xA;Vanara King. Now let us think and make&#xA;preparations at once for proceeding to&#xA;Lanka to redeem the princess.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying this, he handed the sikhamani,&#xA;crest-jewel, of Sita to the prince.&#xA;Rama took the jewel from Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;hand and at the sight of it fainted, racked&#xA;beyond bearing between extremes of joy&#xA;and grief.&#xA;He pressed the jewel to his bosom and&#xA;cried: &amp;ldquo;O Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo; Again he&#xA;embraced Hanuman and said: &amp;ldquo;Heroic son&#xA;of Vayu, blessed are you who have seen&#xA;Sita. I too see her now before me. You&#xA;have, indeed, brought her to me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear hero, my heart&amp;rsquo;s friend!&amp;rdquo; he cried&#xA;&amp;ldquo;tell me everything again in full. Tell me&#xA;once again what Sita said. Let me hear her&#xA;words which are sweet like water to&#xA;parched lips.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman narrated the whole story to&#xA;the eager listeners and Rama wept when&#xA;Hanuman repeated these words of Sita:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Many Rakshasas has my Rama slain,&#xA;but why has he not come here yet to slay&#xA;Ravana and save me from my sufferings?&#xA;Why has he not sent brave Lakshmana to&#xA;slay the wretch? It cannot be that my lord&#xA;has grown indifferent towards me! For I&#xA;know of no wrong I have ever committed&#xA;in thought or word or deed to lose his&#xA;love.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman said: &amp;ldquo;I tried to console her&#xA;saying: &amp;lsquo;Rama is ever thinking of&amp;rsquo; you and&#xA;grieving for you. He knows no rest. Do&#xA;not imagine that Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;have forgotten you. No words of mine&#xA;could describe their grief. Now that I am&#xA;going to tell them you are here, it will not&#xA;be long before they come and destroy&#xA;Ravana and return with you in triumph to&#xA;Ayodhya.&amp;rsquo; It was then she untied the jewel&#xA;from a knot in a corner of her sari and&#xA;gave it to me. I placed it on my head in&#xA;reverence and, securing it, started to&#xA;return. She stopped me and uttered a&#xA;benediction again and said: &amp;lsquo;Friend&#xA;Hanuman convey the news of my welfare&#xA;to the lions, my lord and his brother, to&#xA;king Sugriva and his ministers. Devise&#xA;your plans and help him to come here and&#xA;redeem me. I trust in you, Hanuman,&#xA;absolutely. May God bless you.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lay aside your grief, my Lord,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;continued Hanuman, &amp;ldquo;and think out now&#xA;what has to be done. Sita doubted how&#xA;you and the Vanara army could cross the&#xA;sea. I assured her that she need have no&#xA;fear or doubt on that score, since, by no&#xA;means the strongest among the Vanaras, I&#xA;myself had crossed it as she could see. Isaid to her that I myself could carry Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana on my shoulders and&#xA;cross the sea and bring them there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAMA heard Hanuman with heart and&#xA;eyes overflowing and, when he had come&#xA;to the end of his narrative, said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The deed done by Hanuman none else&#xA;in the world could even conceive of&#xA;attempting, crossing the sea, entering&#xA;Lanka protected by Ravana and his&#xA;formidable hosts and accomplishing the&#xA;task set him by his king not only fully but&#xA;beyond the fondest hopes of all.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And it saddened him to think that it&#xA;was not in his power to reward Hanuman&#xA;at all adequately for the supreme joy he&#xA;had brought. &amp;ldquo;O Hanuman, let this&#xA;embrace&#xA;of&#xA;mine&#xA;stand&#xA;as&#xA;an&#xA;acknowledgment of all that my heart feels&#xA;of gratitude for your great service to me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So saying while his whole being&#xA;thrilled with grateful love, he took&#xA;Hanuman into his arms and clasped him to&#xA;his breast.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sugriva,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;Hanuman has&#xA;indeed wrought a wonder. He entered&#xA;Lanka so strongly guarded by the&#xA;Rakshasas. He has discovered Sita and, by&#xA;consoling her, preserved her life. Bringing&#xA;back good news of her, he has saved my&#xA;life also. But how are we now going to&#xA;cross the sea? How can our huge army&#xA;reach the other shore? Before we can&#xA;attack Ravana&amp;rsquo;s city and the Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;army, we have first to cross the sea. I see&#xA;no way of doing it. Our joy in Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;achievement and the good news he has&#xA;brought is overlaid by anxiety about our&#xA;future course.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But the Vanara king said: &amp;ldquo;What is&#xA;this, my Lord Rama? What need is there&#xA;for dejection? Here are my warriors, ready&#xA;to lay down their lives for you and let it be&#xA;our joy to transport you and Lakshmana to&#xA;Lanka. Have no doubt that we can do it.&#xA;The moment Hanuman saw Lanka, you&#xA;may take it the fortress has fallen. Doubt&#xA;only makes the warrior weak and afraid&#xA;and should be cast aside. Our victory is&#xA;certain. The feeling of confidence in my&#xA;heart at this moment is a good enough&#xA;omen for me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus Sugriva reassured Rama, and&#xA;inspired him to action. Then Rama and&#xA;Hanuman discussed matters about Lanka,&#xA;the town, the fort, the moat and other&#xA;defences. Understanding this, Hanuman&#xA;described the wealth of Lanka, the happy&#xA;lives of the Rakshasas, their confidence in&#xA;Ravana and their affection for him.&#xA;He told Rama of the might and size of&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s army; the strength and structure&#xA;of the fortress; the alertness of the sentry;&#xA;the moats, walls and gates, catapults and&#xA;drawbridges, the care and thoroughness of&#xA;all the arrangements for defence. He also&#xA;explained how the coast too was carefully&#xA;guarded so that no enemy ship could&#xA;approach it.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;And yet you may be certain,&amp;rdquo; he said,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;our Vanara army is fully equal to the&#xA;conquest of Lanka. We have with us&#xA;peerless warriors like Angada, Dwivida,&#xA;Mainda, Jambavan, Panasa, Nala and&#xA;Nila. We have an enormous army. We&#xA;shall fly in the sky and without touching&#xA;the ground destroy Lanka. Its mountains&#xA;and forest defences are nothing to us. We&#xA;shall raze the city to the ground. Fix the&#xA;auspicious time and give us the order to&#xA;start.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Under the star of triumph, Uttara&#xA;Phalguni, at high noon, the army set&#xA;forward towards the southern sea. Good&#xA;omens greeted them.&#xA;As they marched, Rama, Sugriva and&#xA;Lakshmana went conversing with one&#xA;another. &amp;ldquo;If only Sita could know that we&#xA;have set out,&amp;rdquo; said Rama, &amp;ldquo;it would&#xA;encourage her to keep life going.&amp;ldquo;Scouts who knew the way went ahead,&#xA;looking out for enemies lying in ambush.&#xA;They led the army through regions that&#xA;could provide food and drink for the huge&#xA;army. With speed the army crossed&#xA;mountains and forests.&#xA;The Vanaras sometimes carried Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana on their shoulders so that&#xA;the march might be speedy. Every&#xA;moment the enthusiasm of the Vanaras&#xA;increased. They jumped and roared and&#xA;sported. Rama could hear them saying to&#xA;one another: &amp;ldquo;I shall kill Ravana! I shall&#xA;meet and kill Ravana!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Nila and Kumuda went ahead&#xA;reconnoitering in front of the army. Strong&#xA;warriors were kept in the rear, guarding it&#xA;from behind. King Sugriva, Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana were in the middle. Rama&#xA;gave strict orders that the army should&#xA;inflict no harm or hardship on the towns&#xA;and villages on the way. The noise of the&#xA;marching army was like the roar of the sea&#xA;and filled the eight quarters. The dust they&#xA;raised covered the sky.&#xA;When they came to the Mahendra&#xA;Mountain, Rama climbed the peak and&#xA;surveyed the sea.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We should now think and decide,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;said, &amp;ldquo;how the army can cross the sea. Till&#xA;then let it camp and rest in the forest.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Sugriva passed the order to the&#xA;commanders. The Vanaras camped in the&#xA;forest by the seashore.&#xA;When Sugriva, Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;had satisfied themselves that the whole&#xA;army had settled in comfort, the two&#xA;brothers retired apart.&#xA;Rama said: &amp;ldquo;If a person loses a dear&#xA;thing, people say that time will enable him&#xA;to forget about it and he will cease to&#xA;grieve. But Lakshmana, this is not what I&#xA;find.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dejection again seized Rama for the&#xA;thought of Sita and her condition preyed&#xA;on his mind now more than ever before.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;When Ravana seized Sita and carried&#xA;her off,&amp;rdquo; Rama said, breaking down with&#xA;fresh grief, &amp;ldquo;she must have cried aloud &amp;lsquo;Ha&#xA;my Lord! Ha Rama! Ha Lakshmana!&amp;rsquo; But&#xA;she saw no one coming. We failed to go to&#xA;her help. Every time I think of the&#xA;suffering she then must have gone&#xA;through, my grief swells up afresh. What&#xA;am I to do? Like the limbs of one who has&#xA;drunk poison, my whole body burns with&#xA;pain. She is held in the grip of the cruel&#xA;Rakshasis and she is in great anguish.&#xA;Janaka&amp;rsquo;s daughter, the bride who entered&#xA;the home of great Dasaratha, she lies on&#xA;the bare ground, a prisoner surrounded by&#xA;Rakshasis!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Rama!&amp;rdquo; said Lakshmana, &amp;ldquo;cease from&#xA;sorrow. Soon we shall destroy Ravana and&#xA;rescue Sita and take her home to&#xA;Ayodhya. She will enter the city like the&#xA;goddess of chastity. Give up your grief.&#xA;Arm yourself with courage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now let us leave Rama and his host&#xA;here and go back to Ravana. Great poets&#xA;in all languages delineate with sympathy&#xA;even their bad characters allowing gleams&#xA;of goodness to shine through occasionally,&#xA;for nature has not made anybody wholly&#xA;and unredeemably evil.&#xA;The poet&amp;rsquo;s aim is to direct the reader&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;mind into the path of good, the satvik&#xA;way. For this purpose they use all their&#xA;skill and power in developing even their&#xA;rajasik and tamasik characters.&#xA;The reader who is held by rajasik and&#xA;tamasik qualities, naturally tends to&#xA;sympathise with such characters; much&#xA;more so readers below the average who&#xA;are untouched by the satvik element.&#xA;They would regard the deeds of the&#xA;hero and other satvik characters as mere&#xA;fiction invented for blind worship, and&#xA;identify themselves with the rajasik and&#xA;tamasik characters and even claim these&#xA;as their own kith and kin. They would findthemselves attracted by such characters&#xA;and follow their doings with considerable&#xA;interest.&#xA;Paradise Lost, the English epic on a&#xA;Biblical theme, is famous throughout the&#xA;world. In this poem Milton delineates the&#xA;Almighty and Jesus, His spiritual son and&#xA;human incarnation, as well as several&#xA;orders of angels. But the most impressive&#xA;character in the great epic is Satan who&#xA;rebelled against God and brought sin and&#xA;death into this world.&#xA;Critics of English poetry admire&#xA;Milton&amp;rsquo;s wonderful success in the&#xA;characterisation of Satan. Similarly, the&#xA;great dramatic poet Shakespeare has&#xA;created a wonderful character in Shylock,&#xA;the usurer and miser. Even such&#xA;embodiments of despicable qualities are&#xA;presented by the poets as possessing&#xA;courage, determination, energy and other&#xA;good qualities that attract us and serve as&#xA;a bright background to their blackness.&#xA;In Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s portraits of Ravana and&#xA;Kumbhakarna too, we notice the same&#xA;artistic skill. The cook who meets all&#xA;tastes shows his skill in making out of&#xA;bitter vegetables an attractive dish. So&#xA;does the poet show his skill in portraying&#xA;evil.&#xA;The Rakshasa king was somewhat&#xA;ashamed and afraid at the thought of what&#xA;Hanuman had achieved in Lanka. He&#xA;summoned his ministers and took counsel&#xA;with them.&#xA;He began in an apologetic tone. &amp;ldquo;What&#xA;has happened is something strange and&#xA;unexpected. No one has till now been&#xA;known to enter our city, but this envoy of&#xA;Rama has not only entered Lanka, he has&#xA;met and talked with the imprisoned Sita.&#xA;He has destroyed temples and palaces. He&#xA;has slain some of our best warriors. He&#xA;has filled our people with fear. And this&#xA;thing is not likely to stop here. Hence we&#xA;have to consider what should be done.&#xA;You know that the king should decide his&#xA;course of action only after consulting his&#xA;loyal ministers of clear vision and well-&#xA;versed in statecraft. And so I have&#xA;summoned this Council. Rama has&#xA;become an inveterate enemy. Let us&#xA;consider what we should do about it. The&#xA;king has no use for ministers who are not&#xA;straight forward or who not knowing their&#xA;own minds wobble in their advice. The&#xA;matter before us is most important. Rama&#xA;is strong, and so is his army. It is certain&#xA;that they will contrive some how to cross&#xA;the sea. It would be unwise to trust to that&#xA;single defence. Consider well and tell me&#xA;how we can strengthen and secure our city&#xA;and army and what steps we should take&#xA;to defend ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;After listening to the king, the&#xA;members of the Assembly spoke with one&#xA;voice.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Great king! Knowing well that our&#xA;army and our weapons are the strongest in&#xA;the world, why need you be anxious?&#xA;Where is the enemy who dares to attack&#xA;your fortress and who can oppose your&#xA;army with any hope of success? The&#xA;world knows your might. Did you not&#xA;invade the city of Bhogavati and defeat&#xA;the Naga king? Did you not attack&#xA;powerful Kubera and defeat him and his&#xA;Yakshas and capture his Pushpaka&#xA;Vimana as well as this island of Lanka?&#xA;Did not Maya in fear of you sue for your&#xA;favor and friendship and give you his&#xA;daughter in marriage? How many cities in&#xA;the nether region have you not attacked&#xA;and taken? You fought and defeated the&#xA;Kalakeyas. The sons of Varuna, yea, and&#xA;Yama himself have been suppliants for&#xA;your mercy. And who is this Rama? Your&#xA;son Indrajit by himself can destroy Rama&#xA;and his Vanara army. Did he not seize and&#xA;imprison Indra himself and afterwards let&#xA;him go? How can Rama and his Vanaras&#xA;stand against such a warrior? You haveonly to bid Indrajit destroy this Vanara&#xA;crowd and all will be over. Why should&#xA;you, great king, be anxious?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus they spoke in praise of their king.&#xA;The Commander-in-chief Prahasta rose&#xA;like a great black cloud. &amp;ldquo;You, who&#xA;subdued in battle the Devas, Danavas and&#xA;Gandharvas, why should you, oh King of&#xA;kings, feel anxious because of these little&#xA;creatures? It is true that the monkey came&#xA;here and caught us napping and did some&#xA;mischief. But this sort of thing will never&#xA;happen again. If he comes again, I know&#xA;how to manage him. I alone can destroy&#xA;the whole Vanara race, if only you will&#xA;order it. You need not fear any danger&#xA;from this small indiscretion of yours, the&#xA;abduction of Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Next Durmukha rose and roared: &amp;ldquo;We&#xA;shall not let this monkey&amp;rsquo;s bravado and&#xA;undeserved good luck go unavenged. I&#xA;shall go this very instant and destroy the&#xA;Vanara army, root and branch, and&#xA;return.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vajradamshtra stood with a terrible&#xA;iron club in his hand and cried: &amp;ldquo;Here is&#xA;my weapon unwashed and still covered&#xA;with the blood and flesh of my foes. Why&#xA;waste your time talking about this&#xA;monkey? Are not Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;our enemies? I shall slay them first and&#xA;then destroy the Vanara army and re turn&#xA;immediately. Only let me go. I have a&#xA;piece of advice to give you, King, if you&#xA;would listen. Let us order some Rakshasa&#xA;warriors to put on human form and&#xA;approach Rama, telling him, &amp;lsquo;Bharata has&#xA;sent us in advance. A great army is&#xA;coming behind to help you.&amp;rsquo; While Rama&#xA;is thus fooled into negligence, our&#xA;Rakshasa army can travel through the sky&#xA;and destroy him and his followers on the&#xA;other shore. This is my advice.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Nikumbha, son of Kumbhakarna, rose&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;All of you may stay here with&#xA;the King. I shall go alone and meet and&#xA;destroy the enemy and bring you the&#xA;news.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Another Rakshasa, licking his lips, said&#xA;with gusto: &amp;ldquo;I shall go alone and kill and&#xA;feast on the flesh of these two men, Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana. Please let me go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus one after another they got up and&#xA;spoke brave words to please Ravana and&#xA;then all of them stood up together and,&#xA;raising their weapons, roared aloud.&#xA;At that Vibhishana, the younger&#xA;brother of Ravana, made them all sit&#xA;down, and said to the king with folded&#xA;hands:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Brother, what these people say is&#xA;sweet to hear but not true or good to act&#xA;upon. Anything done in violation of Niti&#xA;shastra (the Science of Politics) can only&#xA;lead to grief and ruin. It is only after&#xA;trying sama (conciliation), dana (buying&#xA;off the enemy) and bheda (sowing&#xA;discord) that one should think of using&#xA;danda (force of arms.) against a foe. If&#xA;you take the advice of these people and&#xA;start a war now, it would mean the&#xA;destruction of Lanka and all of us. We&#xA;should also consider the demands of&#xA;dharma. It was not right, it was indeed a&#xA;great sin for you, to have seized and&#xA;brought Rama&amp;rsquo;s wife here. We should first&#xA;cleanse ourselves of this sin. What harm&#xA;did Rama do to us? What Rama did in the&#xA;Dandaka forest was in pure self-defence&#xA;and the defence of those that looked to&#xA;him for protection. He fought with and&#xA;slew only those that went out to slay him.&#xA;His actions surely do not justify your&#xA;carrying away his wife. And even if we&#xA;had any just complaint against him, we&#xA;should have met in battle. Instead of that,&#xA;to contrive his absence and seize his wife&#xA;was very wrong and sinful. When the fault&#xA;is on your side, it is morally not right that&#xA;we should think of battle. Further,&#xA;warcraft requires that before fighting we&#xA;should take some measure of Rama&amp;rsquo;sstrength and that of his army. We have&#xA;had some taste of Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s strength and&#xA;skill. It is pointless to talk lightly of him.&#xA;Did he not do remarkable things? Though&#xA;our own strength may be great, we should&#xA;weigh it against the enemy&amp;rsquo;s strength and&#xA;then decide whether we should seek war&#xA;or avoid it. But first it is essential that we&#xA;should restore Sita. My advice is this,&#xA;before Rama and the Vanaras attack&#xA;Lanka, let us restore Sita. Dear brother, I&#xA;am saying all this for your good. Pray, do&#xA;not be angry with me. We should first set&#xA;right our own fault and then think of other&#xA;things.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus with folded hands Vibhishana&#xA;besought Ravana.&#xA;Though Ravana was pleased with the&#xA;vainglorious words of his ministers and&#xA;generals, there was doubt lurking in his&#xA;mind.&#xA;Hence, after listening to&#xA;Vibhishana, he said: &amp;ldquo;Let us meet again&#xA;tomorrow and consider this matter.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He adjourned the Council, and retired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>62 RAVANA CALLS A COUNCIL AGAIN</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AS soon as the day dawned,&#xA;Vibhishana went to the king. He had&#xA;thought deeply over the matter and had&#xA;come to a decision. His brother&amp;rsquo;s welfare&#xA;demanded that he should seek somehow&#xA;to convert and save him.&#xA;Vibhishana entered the royal palace&#xA;and stood with folded hands before the&#xA;king. Ravana sent away all but the&#xA;principal Ministers and asked his brother&#xA;to speak.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My brother and my lord,&amp;rdquo; began&#xA;Vibhishana, &amp;ldquo;forgive me if what I say is&#xA;not pleasing to your ears. My desire is not&#xA;to flatter but to save you from a great&#xA;danger while there is yet time. I beg of&#xA;you to listen to me, consider well what I&#xA;say and then decide on your course of&#xA;action.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ever since you brought Sita to Lanka&#xA;we see only evil omens. Even when the&#xA;libation is poured with the correct mantra,&#xA;the flame does not spring to receive it.&#xA;One finds snakes in places of worship.&#xA;Ants infest food offerings. The udders of&#xA;cows are dry and yield no milk. Elephants,&#xA;horses, camels and monkeys fall sick,&#xA;reject food and behave strangely.&#xA;Medicines have lost their efficacy. Crows&#xA;perch in numbers on the housetops&#xA;making hideous noises. Vultures circling&#xA;overhead fill the augurs with anxiety.&#xA;Foxes boldly enter the city and howl at&#xA;unusual hours. Wild beasts haunt the&#xA;streets. These portents should not be&#xA;disregarded. I beg of you, restore Sita to&#xA;her husband. It is only since her coming&#xA;here that these omens are noticed as you&#xA;can verify by asking others. Why should&#xA;we, who have so much to lose, needlessly&#xA;incur any one&amp;rsquo;s enmity? Let us restore Sita&#xA;to her people and live happily.&amp;rdquo; Thus did&#xA;Vibhishana plead earnestly with his&#xA;brother.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Never, never!&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Ravana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let there be no talk here of Sita being&#xA;returned to her people. I do not think&#xA;much of this enemy. I see nothing to be&#xA;afraid of. Now, you may go.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Though he spoke thus and was&#xA;obstinate, Ravana had no peace of mind.&#xA;Sita had not yielded to him and his own&#xA;near kinsmen disapproved of his conduct.&#xA;He was agitated, but putting on an air of&#xA;confidence and unconcern he summoned&#xA;the Council again.&#xA;Lust and injured&#xA;vanity kept him from the straight path, but&#xA;he found some consolation in taking&#xA;counsel from others.&#xA;From the palace to the Hall of Council&#xA;he drove through the street in a golden&#xA;chariot drawn by noble steeds. Warriors,&#xA;holding swords and shields and wearing&#xA;brilliant uniforms, marched in front,&#xA;behind and on the sides. Others mountedon elephants and horses and armed with&#xA;axes, spears and other terrible weapons,&#xA;followed the chariot. Trumpets were&#xA;blown and drums beaten.&#xA;As the Lord of Lanka, accompanied by&#xA;his retinue, passed majestically through&#xA;the royal street, his people bent low their&#xA;heads and folded their hands and invoked&#xA;victory for him. As he entered the hall,&#xA;drums and trumpets sounded loudly and&#xA;filled the eight quarters.&#xA;Ravana took his seat on an agate throne&#xA;in the great hall constructed by Maya&#xA;which shone in all the splendor of gold&#xA;and silver and precious carpets.&#xA;Hundreds of demons stood sentry&#xA;without. Obedient to the call of the King,&#xA;thousands of Rakshasa warriors had&#xA;assembled in the chamber. Long rows of&#xA;vehicles stood in the streets. Within the&#xA;chamber each was assigned a seat&#xA;appropriate to his rank.&#xA;Priests and chanters of the Vedas came&#xA;in hundreds and after receiving tokens of&#xA;respect from the king were seated in the&#xA;hall.&#xA;Vibhishana, Suka, Prahasta and others&#xA;bowed before the king and sat in their&#xA;respective&#xA;places.&#xA;Devoted&#xA;officers&#xA;thronged the hall, all brave and efficient&#xA;and waiting to fulfil the commands of&#xA;their king.&#xA;The air was heavy with rich perfume.&#xA;The assembly equalled Indra&amp;rsquo;s in splendor&#xA;and everyone felt that momentous&#xA;decisions were to be taken. Ravana broke&#xA;the hushed expectant silence of the great&#xA;assembly in a voice deep and resonant as&#xA;thunder.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;You are strong, brave and&#xA;skilled in the arts of peace and war. You&#xA;can find a way out of every difficulty.&#xA;Never so far has your advice miscarried.&#xA;And so, once again, I seek your counsel.&#xA;You know well what I have done. I have&#xA;brought here Sita who was living in the&#xA;Dandaka forest. My desire for her so&#xA;entirely possesses me that sending her&#xA;back is to me unthinkable. She has not so&#xA;far submitted to my wishes and entertains&#xA;a foolish hope that Rama will come here&#xA;and redeem her. I have told her that it is&#xA;an impossible wish and a vain hope.&#xA;Finally, she asked for a year&amp;rsquo;s time and I&#xA;gave it to her. I now seek your counsel.&#xA;My desire is unfulfilled. I can never agree&#xA;to sending Sita back and begging&#xA;forgiveness from Rama. Till now neither&#xA;you, my great warriors, nor I have known&#xA;defeat in battle. True, a big monkey&#xA;somehow contrived to cross the sea and&#xA;wrought some mischief here. But hard&#xA;indeed will it be for Rama and the Vanara&#xA;army to cross the sea and come here. And&#xA;even if they did come, what need we fear?&#xA;What chance have they against us? On the&#xA;other side of the sea, Rama, Lakshmana,&#xA;Sugriva and the Vanaras are encamped.&#xA;Think how we can slay Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana. I should have summoned the&#xA;Council earlier. But Kumbhakarna was in&#xA;his period of sleep and I waited till he&#xA;woke up.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus spoke Ravana, blinded by lust,&#xA;hiding his real anxiety and mixing a little&#xA;falsehood with truth. For Sita had not&#xA;asked for a year&amp;rsquo;s time. She had absolutely&#xA;rejected his advances, but he asked her to&#xA;reconsider and gave her a year&amp;rsquo;s time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>63 VIBHISHANA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;KUMBHAKARNA,&#xA;the&#xA;younger&#xA;brother of Ravana, spoke in the assembly:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Great King! Ignoring the principles of&#xA;statecraft, you have run into a great&#xA;danger. If you had any grievance against&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana, you should have&#xA;met them face to face and defeated and&#xA;slain them before carrying off Sita. If you&#xA;had acted thus, even Sita would have&#xA;admired you and there would then have&#xA;been a possibility of her accepting you. As&#xA;waters flow down a mountain, she wouldhave followed a victorious warrior. You&#xA;did not consult us before committing the&#xA;offence and incurred the enmity of Rama,&#xA;but now, when it is too late, you seek our&#xA;counsel. This is not the right way of doing&#xA;things that a king should follow.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having&#xA;spoken&#xA;thus&#xA;harshly,&#xA;Kumbhakarna looked at the king and saw&#xA;he was pained. Affectionate as he was&#xA;brave, he could not endure the sadness in&#xA;his brother&amp;rsquo;s face.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let by-gones be by-gones,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;thought, &amp;ldquo;one cannot forsake one&amp;rsquo;s honor.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kumbhakarna was under no delusion&#xA;as to the consequences, but his generous&#xA;spirit accepted them for the sake of the&#xA;brother he idolised. He knew that Rama&#xA;was a peerless warrior.&#xA;He knew the power of his bow and also&#xA;the limitations of the boons that Ravana&#xA;had received from the gods. But it was no&#xA;good taking the heart out of others in the&#xA;face of unavoidable peril and so be also&#xA;began to speak vaunting words like the&#xA;rest:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What You did may be wrong, and so&#xA;too the way you chose to do it. You have&#xA;done first what you should have done last.&#xA;And yet, it does not matter. I shall slay&#xA;Rama. Do not be afraid. One or two of his&#xA;arrows may touch me. In spite of it, I shall&#xA;kill him and drink his blood and victory&#xA;will be yours. My brother, lay aside your&#xA;care, and think of other things.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Some&#xA;people&#xA;suggest&#xA;that&#xA;Kumbhakarna was dull and so he thus&#xA;contradicted himself. But it was not&#xA;stupidity, it was due to generous affection&#xA;that he accepted the inevitable fearlessly.&#xA;He was a proud warrior who loved his&#xA;brother and his people and he decided on&#xA;honorable death with them.&#xA;Prahasta&#xA;was&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;chief&#xA;counsellor. He spoke of the King&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;invincible strength and cheered him up.&#xA;Ravana now grew enthusiastic and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Didn&amp;rsquo;t I vanquish Kubera? Didn&amp;rsquo;t I&#xA;drive him out and make Lanka my own?&#xA;Who dare come here and oppose me? Let&#xA;us see!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The assembly applauded these words.&#xA;Vibhishana alone did not join in the&#xA;applause. He did not mind the wrath of his&#xA;royal brother. He felt it was his duty to&#xA;warn him of the danger and the error of&#xA;his ways.&#xA;He felt bound to make his utmost effort&#xA;to save him and the Rakshasa race from&#xA;doom. He stood up and spoke:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have brought Sita and with her,&#xA;death for yourself and your race. Your&#xA;first duty to yourself and your people is to&#xA;restore her to Rama. If you fail in this, we&#xA;shall all assuredly perish. This is certain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;He went on describing Rama&amp;rsquo;s strength&#xA;and skill and his mastery of weapons. He&#xA;spoke frankly and without fear.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If we oppose Rama,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;defeat&#xA;is inevitable. Our fortune is sinking. Let&#xA;us restore Sita, seek Rama&amp;rsquo;s pardon and&#xA;thus save our kingdom, our lives and&#xA;possessions and honor.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;At this importunity of Vibhishana,&#xA;Indrajit, Ravana&amp;rsquo;s son, lost patience and&#xA;burst out:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My uncle&amp;rsquo;s words fill me with shame.&#xA;What race are we? What is our strength? I&#xA;marvel that a descendant of Pulastya&#xA;should talk in this strain and that the&#xA;assembly should meekly sit and listen. My&#xA;uncle has only betrayed his evil intentions.&#xA;We can never agree to his proposal. Are&#xA;we to be afraid of two petty humans? Did&#xA;I not beat Indra down in battle and his&#xA;hordes of gods? Does not the whole world&#xA;tremble even now in terror before us?&#xA;Vibhishana&amp;rsquo;s counsel is an insult to our&#xA;race!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vibhishana answered gently: &amp;ldquo;Boy,&#xA;you lack experience. That is why you talk&#xA;thus. You are the king&amp;rsquo;s son and should behis best friend. But I am afraid you are&#xA;proving yourself his worst enemy. And&#xA;you, ministers who ought to give good&#xA;advice, you are leading the king to ruin.&#xA;My Lord of Lanka! Do not reject what I&#xA;say. Return Sita honorably to Rama and&#xA;seek his forgiveness. This is the only way.&#xA;There is no other. Failing to pursue the&#xA;only available course, we shall all perish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s rage was now uncontrollable.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I put up with your talk thus far,&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;shouted in anger, &amp;ldquo;because you are my&#xA;brother. Else you would by now be dead.&#xA;A brother, I see, is one&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy. All&#xA;the world knows that the envy of brothers&#xA;brings dishonor and discomfiture to the&#xA;brave. They hide their real desire and wait&#xA;for their time and, when it comes, do not&#xA;hesitate to practise their treachery. How&#xA;true is the complaint of the wild elephants&#xA;in the story! We are not afraid of the&#xA;burning fire. &amp;lsquo;We do not mind the hunters&#xA;and their long spears. The noosed ropes&#xA;and the chains can do little harm to us.&#xA;But the elephants which join the hunters&#xA;and give us trouble, these brothers and&#xA;cousins who turn against us, they are our&#xA;terror!&amp;rsquo; Yes. So long as one is safe and&#xA;prosperous, the brother smiles and talks&#xA;pleasantly. But when danger comes, he is&#xA;ready to leave. The bee does not stay with&#xA;the flower after the honey has been&#xA;sucked. It goes in search of another&#xA;flower. Brothers and cousins are no better&#xA;than these bees. One cannot trust them in&#xA;adversity. If any one else should have&#xA;spoken as you have done, Vibhishana, I&#xA;would have slain him here and now. Base&#xA;fellow! You are a disgrace to our race!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unable to bear the insult, Vibhishana&#xA;rose and said: &amp;ldquo;My brother, you may&#xA;speak as you please. Though you have&#xA;wandered from the way of dharma, you&#xA;are still my brother and I warn you that,&#xA;drawn by the noose of Yama, you are&#xA;going along the path of destruction. My&#xA;advice, salutary but unpleasant, you reject.&#xA;It is easy to speak sweet words. Your&#xA;ministers are doing it. I spoke for your&#xA;good. But truth is bitter and you hate it.&#xA;The terrible vision of Rama&amp;rsquo;s darts&#xA;destroying you is before my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye&#xA;and makes me speak as I do. You call me&#xA;your enemy. Defend your city and your&#xA;life as well as you can. God bless you! I&#xA;am going. May you be happy! I thought I&#xA;could serve you in your need, but you will&#xA;not let me. You imagine that I envy you&#xA;and your possessions. Good counsel is&#xA;rejected by one whose end is near.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having spoken thus, and realising that&#xA;there was no place for him in Lanka&#xA;thereafter, Vibhishana renounced all his&#xA;possessions and, rising into the sky,&#xA;proceeded straight to the spot where Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana were encamped. Four&#xA;good Rakshasa friends went along with&#xA;him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>64 THE VANARA&#39;S DOUBT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HAVING committed a sin and run into&#xA;danger, Ravana did not see how to&#xA;extricate himself. Like other kings in a&#xA;quandary, he called a council for&#xA;consultation.&#xA;Many&#xA;spoke&#xA;flattering&#xA;words. Only two spoke harshly.&#xA;One said: &amp;ldquo;You have committed a fault.&#xA;But I will give up my life for you.&amp;rdquo; This&#xA;was Kumbhakarna.&#xA;The other, Vibhishana, said: &amp;ldquo;You have&#xA;committed a sin, but there is still time for&#xA;repentance&#xA;and&#xA;escape&#xA;from&#xA;consequences. If you take this right and&#xA;wise course, we shall all escape&#xA;destruction and live happily. Restore Sita&#xA;and seek pardon of Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Never,&amp;rdquo; said Ravana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Then our ways part and I leave you,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;said Vibhishana.&#xA;In a conflict of duties, each one follows&#xA;his own nature. All cannot follow one and&#xA;the same path.Ravana&amp;rsquo;s self-indulgent vanity would&#xA;not let him admit his error or retrace his&#xA;steps. Very rarely does one who has&#xA;committed a sin confess defeat. It requires&#xA;some courage of a bad sort to commit a&#xA;sin. But it requires much greater courage&#xA;of a noble kind to confess it.&#xA;It was this noble courage that Ravana&#xA;lacked. When an evil is being perpetrated,&#xA;the friends of the evil-doer face a difficult&#xA;problem. Some are constrained against&#xA;their better judgment to espouse the&#xA;wrong cause through gratitude for past&#xA;kindness, a sense of loyalty, or affinities&#xA;of blood.&#xA;Others think it their duty to try and&#xA;reform the sinner, regardless of his anger&#xA;and hatred and consequent danger to&#xA;themselves and if their efforts fail they&#xA;part company from the sinner, rather than&#xA;abandon dharma and give their support to&#xA;the sinner who persists in crime. They&#xA;bold that it can never be one&amp;rsquo;s duty to&#xA;support or cooperate with adharma.&#xA;It would indeed be adharma to refrain&#xA;from doing one&amp;rsquo;s best to reform the sinner&#xA;or to cooperate in his sin.&#xA;In the&#xA;Ramayana, Kumbhakarna and Vibhishana&#xA;represent these two different types. If&#xA;Ravana had told Vibhishana: &amp;ldquo;Come, let&#xA;us go to the Dandaka forest and carry off&#xA;Sita,&amp;rdquo; it is inconceivable that Vibhishana&#xA;could have complied. That is why we&#xA;respect Vibhishana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;At least now restore Sita and be&#xA;happy,&amp;rdquo; Vibhishana said and tried to&#xA;persuade Ravana. &amp;ldquo;Rama will surely&#xA;forgive you. Take the way of dharma.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Ravana would not listen, and&#xA;Vibhishana, as an enemy of sin, had no&#xA;alternative but to part company from the&#xA;perverse wickedness of Ravana. Hence it&#xA;would be wrong to find fault with&#xA;Vibhishana. And if we find fault with him,&#xA;it is because our concern for dharma is&#xA;weak.&#xA;But can we find fault with&#xA;Kumbhakarna? We cannot do this either.&#xA;He is one of those noble soldiers of lost&#xA;causes whose faults we forgive for their&#xA;selfless loyalty and sublime acceptance of&#xA;death.&#xA;But, because we cannot condemn&#xA;Kumbhakarna, it does not follow that we&#xA;must condemn Vibhishana. There are&#xA;some people today who rejoice in arguing&#xA;against dharma and against Vibhishana;&#xA;hence this elaboration of a simple point.&#xA;Men are restrained from evil by the&#xA;wholesome fear that if they commit sin&#xA;they would forfeit the affection and&#xA;goodwill of their friends and kinsmen.&#xA;This fear is a strong incentive to good&#xA;behavior and its removal would be a&#xA;serious loss in society.&#xA;All this is forgotten by those who argue&#xA;that Vibhishana was a traitor. Ravana was&#xA;the first, unfortunately by no means the&#xA;last, to dub him by that name. Those who&#xA;are anxious to retain the support of&#xA;kinsfolk while pursuing evil ways&#xA;disapprove of Vibhishana&amp;rsquo;s conduct. But&#xA;Vibhishana was not afraid of being a&#xA;traitor. He would have nothing to do with&#xA;adharma. His course was, however, not&#xA;easy as we shall see.&#xA;The Vanara chieftains standing on the&#xA;northern seashore saw all of a sudden the&#xA;sky lit up with a golden glow like the&#xA;summit of Mount Meru. It was too steady&#xA;to be a flash of lightning.&#xA;In&#xA;the&#xA;brightness&#xA;could&#xA;be&#xA;distinguished the forms of five big&#xA;Rakshasas. Sugriva, the king and&#xA;commander of the Vanaras, looking at&#xA;them said: &amp;ldquo;There is no doubt these are&#xA;Rakshasas come from Lanka with hostile&#xA;designs.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;On hearing this, the Vanara warriors&#xA;armed themselves with trees and boulders&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;Let us go. We shall interceptand slay them and bring them down to&#xA;earth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vibhishana, hearing these words of the&#xA;Vanaras, showed no signs of fear but from&#xA;above with calm courage spoke out in a&#xA;clear voice:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Vibhishana stands here before you,&#xA;the brother of Ravana, the wicked king of&#xA;the Rakshasas. I am here before you, none&#xA;other than brother to Ravana, who killed&#xA;Jatayu and carried off Sita by force and is&#xA;how keeping her a prisoner in Lanka. In&#xA;vain I strove to turn him from his wicked&#xA;designs and counselled him to restore Sita&#xA;and seek Rama&amp;rsquo;s forgiveness. All the&#xA;response I got was disdain and public&#xA;insult. Hence I am standing here before&#xA;you. Renouncing kingdom, wife and&#xA;children, I seek service and sanctuary at&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet. I pray you, convey this&#xA;information to Rama.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva mistrusted the good faith of the&#xA;Rakshasa king&amp;rsquo;s brother and reported thus&#xA;to Rama: &amp;ldquo;Vibhishana, the brother of&#xA;Ravana, has come here with four&#xA;Rakshasa friends seeking sanctuary at&#xA;your feet. They are standing there in the&#xA;sky. Consider well, you who are skilled in&#xA;affairs, what should be done now. These&#xA;Rakshasas are adepts in duplicity. They&#xA;can make themselves invisible and do&#xA;many other tricks. They have all the skill&#xA;and courage of the wicked. One cannot&#xA;trust them. I believe that these Rakshasas&#xA;have been sent by Ravana himself. They&#xA;have come here to mix with us for&#xA;subversive purposes. Or else they intend&#xA;seeking an opportunity to assassinate the&#xA;leaders in our camp. Whatever Vibhishana&#xA;may say, we cannot forget that he is the&#xA;brother of our foe. By birth he belongs to&#xA;the wicked Rakshasa race. How can we&#xA;trust him? This is some trick of Ravana, I&#xA;have no doubt. It is best to kill Vibhishana&#xA;and his companions right now. If we&#xA;admit him into our camp, he will betray us&#xA;at the first opportunity and return to his&#xA;own people. Permit us, therefore, to&#xA;destroy forthwith Ravana&amp;rsquo;s brother and his&#xA;followers.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having thus frankly expressed his&#xA;feelings at the sight of the Rakshasa,&#xA;Sugriva stood in silence, awaiting Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;reply.&#xA;Rama listened and turned to&#xA;Hanuman and other leaders and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have heard the words of the King&#xA;who is well-versed in policy. Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;brother has come and waits there for our&#xA;pleasure. I wish to know your opinion on&#xA;this matter. In times of crisis, one should&#xA;ask for the advice of friends. Tell me&#xA;without reservation what you feel in your&#xA;hearts.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Angada, the Vanara prince said: &amp;ldquo;He&#xA;has come from our enemy&amp;rsquo;s camp. We do&#xA;not know whether he has come of his own&#xA;accord or was sent by our foe. While&#xA;perhaps it would not be right to reject him&#xA;out of hand, it would be dangerous to&#xA;accept him without testing him. Let us at&#xA;least watch his behavior carefully without&#xA;giving him any opening for mischief. If&#xA;his movements are suspicious, we can&#xA;throw him out. If they are friendly and&#xA;show good faith, we shall accept him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus spoke the son of Vali.&#xA;Sarabha said: &amp;ldquo;I do not think it safe to&#xA;admit him now or to decide later what to&#xA;do with him. Even now, let us test him&#xA;through skilful questioners and decide&#xA;once and for all what to do with him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Jambavan said: &amp;ldquo;Nothing can be&#xA;discovered by testing such persons. If he&#xA;is&#xA;come&#xA;here&#xA;hiding&#xA;treacherous&#xA;intentions, no test can discover the truth.&#xA;Ravana is our inveterate foe. His brother&#xA;says that he has all of a sudden broken&#xA;with him and come over to us. This&#xA;sudden rupture with a brother is hard to&#xA;believe. We have not yet crossed the sea.&#xA;What is his motive in seeking safety with&#xA;us while we are on this hither shore? Allthis is very suspicious. They are a&#xA;deceitful race. I think we should not admit&#xA;him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Mainda said: &amp;ldquo;How can we reject a&#xA;man on mere suspicion? Only after careful&#xA;examination can we decide how to deal&#xA;with him. He says that he has forsaken&#xA;Ravana and come over to us. We can find&#xA;out the truth of this statement. Some of us&#xA;should talk to him and then decide. Surely&#xA;we have enough ability to do this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then Rama turned to Hanuman the&#xA;wise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>65 THE DOCTRINE OF SURRENDER AND GRACE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN response to Rama&amp;rsquo;s invitation,&#xA;Hanuman expressed his opinion in clear,&#xA;sweet and pregnant words:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why should you ask for our advice?&#xA;Not even Brihaspati has anything to tell&#xA;you that you do not already know. If it is&#xA;dangerous to admit Vibhishana, how is the&#xA;danger met by delay and trial? Where is&#xA;the time or opportunity for a test? More&#xA;over, Vibhishana has not approached us&#xA;stealthily. He has come to us with frank&#xA;openness and a clear object. What is there&#xA;for scouts to discover about him? It has&#xA;been said by some that his sudden advent&#xA;is suspicious. But why? What wonder is&#xA;there if Vibhishana became disgusted with&#xA;Ravana and foresaw his certain disgrace&#xA;and a defeat? What wonder is there if he&#xA;recognised your heroic virtues and&#xA;nobility and the certainty of your victory?&#xA;To me the time and manner of his coming&#xA;give no room for suspicion. It has been&#xA;suggested that before admitting him our&#xA;leaders should put him questions and&#xA;examine his answers. But one who knows&#xA;that he is suspected would cease to speak&#xA;or behave naturally. He would be afraid&#xA;that we are out to find only faults in him.&#xA;And thus his real nature will not be&#xA;revealed. I see no cause for suspicion in&#xA;the face or speech of this Rakshasa&#xA;suppliant. His carefree looks disclose a&#xA;guiltless heart. The wise say that the face&#xA;is a perfect mirror of the heart. I think that&#xA;Vibhishana has come here honestly to&#xA;seek sanctuary at your feet. And there is&#xA;nothing strange in his action. He knows&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s real weakness. He knows that&#xA;the lord of Lanka is fated to fall. He&#xA;knows too that you have slain Vali and&#xA;given his kingdom to Sugriva. Granting&#xA;that his real motive is to secure for&#xA;himself the sovereignty of Lanka, there is&#xA;nothing wrong in it and certainly it is a&#xA;guarantee that he will be loyal to us.&#xA;Hence I feel that we should admit him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Vanara chiefs thus differed in their&#xA;views. Kumbhakarna acted according to&#xA;ordinary morality. This was a simple thing&#xA;that everybody could understand. But&#xA;Vibhishana followed a higher morality.&#xA;The path he chose was more difficult and&#xA;likely to be blamed.&#xA;He knew (how could anyone else&#xA;know?) his inward suffering at the thought&#xA;of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s evil doings. Ordinary people&#xA;could not sympathise with his situation.&#xA;Hence the Vanaras failed to understand&#xA;the conflict in his mind. Even today&#xA;people find it hard, without elaborate&#xA;explanation, to appreciate Vibhishana&#xA;aright.&#xA;Patiently, Rama listened to the various&#xA;views of the Vanara chiefs. When at last&#xA;he heard Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s words he was filled&#xA;with joy.&#xA;Rama, steadfast in his own dharma,&#xA;found satisfaction in Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s utterance.&#xA;A good man is glad when a friend&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;opinion supports his decision on a&#xA;question of duty.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If a man comes as a friend,&amp;rdquo; said&#xA;Rama, &amp;ldquo;how can I reject him? It is against&#xA;the law of my life. All of you, my friends&#xA;and helpers, should know this. Once a&#xA;man surrenders himself, one should&#xA;overlook all his faults.&amp;ldquo;But Sugriva was not satisfied. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This Rakshasa has on his own&#xA;showing deserted his brother whose cause&#xA;he considers lost. How can one put faith in&#xA;a person who forsakes his own brother in&#xA;his need?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Valmiki records that on bearing these&#xA;words of Sugriva, Rama turned to&#xA;Lakshmana with a smile. Probably the&#xA;smile was provoked by Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;forgetfulness of his own fraternal conduct&#xA;in&#xA;his&#xA;indignant&#xA;condemnation&#xA;of&#xA;Vibhishana!&#xA;Rama said to Sugriva: &amp;ldquo;I see what you&#xA;mean. But listen. It is natural for kings to&#xA;suspect brothers and neighbor kings.&#xA;Good kings who entertain no such&#xA;suspicion are exceptions. Most kings&#xA;imagine that brothers envy them. What&#xA;wonder then if Ravana suspected and&#xA;insulted Vibhishana? It follows that&#xA;Vibhishana feared danger to himself if he&#xA;stayed on in Lanka. I conclude therefore&#xA;that he has no sinister motive against us in&#xA;coming here for refuge. Let us go further&#xA;and grant that he has eyes on the kingdom,&#xA;expecting Ravana&amp;rsquo;s defeat at our hands.&#xA;Even in this ambition there is nothing&#xA;wrong. Well, Lakshmana, can we expect&#xA;all people to be like our Bharata?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having said this, Rama was silent for a&#xA;moment, lost in remembrance of Bharata&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;selfless love. Then he spoke: &amp;ldquo;Who in the&#xA;world is as lucky as I am? Who has a&#xA;brother like Bharata? And what a father I&#xA;had! His love for me was so great that his&#xA;life fled when I came away to the forest.&#xA;And my friends, who else is blessed like&#xA;me with friends such as you?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having spoken thus he wiped the tears&#xA;in his eyes, and went back to the subject&#xA;on hand.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I see no point in the argument that&#xA;Vibhishana will forsake us, as he has&#xA;forsaken his brother. He had cause for&#xA;forsaking his brother, and can have none&#xA;for leaving us. We do not want Lanka, and&#xA;if, as is natural, he wants it, he can get it&#xA;only through our victory. From the point&#xA;of view of policy, it would be a mistake to&#xA;reject Vibhishana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;But there is a stronger reason. When&#xA;one comes to me for refuge, I cannot&#xA;reject him. This is my dharma. It does not&#xA;matter if as a result of this I suffer. Even&#xA;at the cost of life I must do this duty of&#xA;mine. Never can I deviate from it. Verily,&#xA;I tell you, even if Ravana himself came to&#xA;me for sanctuary, I would accept him&#xA;without hesitation. How then can I reject&#xA;his brother who has done me no wrong?&#xA;Go and fetch Vibhishana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My Lord Rama! It is wonderful how&#xA;clearly the right stands out demonstrated&#xA;when you speak!&amp;rdquo; said Sugriva. &amp;ldquo;I see&#xA;things clearly now. I shall go and bring&#xA;Vibhishana. May he too become a loving&#xA;friend of yours, even like us!&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;Sugriva went to fetch Vibhishana.&#xA;In the Vaishnava tradition, this,&#xA;episode, in which Vibhishana is taken by&#xA;the prince into his camp and innermost&#xA;council, is held to be as important as the&#xA;Bhagavad&#xA;Gita&#xA;episode&#xA;in&#xA;the&#xA;Mahabharata.&#xA;It illustrates the doctrine that the Lord&#xA;accepts all who in absolute surrender seek&#xA;shelter at his feet, regardless of their&#xA;merits or defects. Their sins are burnt out&#xA;by the mere act of surrender. This is a&#xA;message of hope to erring humanity. It is&#xA;the heart of the Vaishnava faith that there&#xA;is hope for the worst of us if only we&#xA;surrender ourselves to the Lord.&#xA;But why should I restrict this doctrine&#xA;to the Vaishnava tradition? Is not this the&#xA;heart of all the religious traditions in our&#xA;land, yes, and of all the religions in the&#xA;world? Every world teacher stresses this&#xA;certainty of relief and redemption. It is not&#xA;to Arjuna only that Krishna said: &amp;ldquo;Have&#xA;no fear, cast off all doubt, I shall destroyall your sins.&amp;rdquo; Wherever in the world God&#xA;has spoken to mankind in a human voice,&#xA;He has given this assurance.&#xA;There are two ways in which we can&#xA;regard Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s account of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;acceptance of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s brother. The poet&#xA;describes the rules of policy, the matters&#xA;to be examined before one can accept a&#xA;visitor from the enemy&amp;rsquo;s camp.&#xA;This is shown in the speeches of the&#xA;Vanara&#xA;king,&#xA;the&#xA;cultured&#xA;and&#xA;accomplished Hanuman, and Rama, the&#xA;firm upholder of dharma. But in addition&#xA;to right policy, we see here Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;character and personality due to nature&#xA;and nurture.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;I cannot reject anyone who&#xA;comes to me for protection. This is my&#xA;dharma. If Ravana himself came to me, I&#xA;would not reject him.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Those who look on Rama as an avatar&#xA;of God find in this utterance the essence&#xA;of scripture. The solemn assurance which&#xA;Krishna gives to Arjuna later in the Gita,&#xA;that assurance the Prince of Ayodhya&#xA;declares in the presence of Sugriva and&#xA;others in this Vibhishana episode of the&#xA;Ramayana.&#xA;This divine assurance is the life and&#xA;light that a world filled with sin and&#xA;darkness, needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>66 THE GREAT CAUSEWAY</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/rAmAyaNam/kAvyam/bhAShAntaram/en/rAjagopAlAchAri/66_THE_GREAT_CAUSEWAY/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MEANWHILE Ravana did something&#xA;foolish. He sent a scout to seduce Sugriva&#xA;from his loyalty to Rama. This Rakshasa,&#xA;Suka by name, flew across and in disguise&#xA;met Sugriva in secret and with every&#xA;appearance of benevolent solicitude spoke&#xA;to him thus:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ravana, the king of Lanka, has sent&#xA;me because of his affection and regard for&#xA;you. He sends you his fraternal greetings.&#xA;You are a king and he is another and there&#xA;is no sense in your staking your high&#xA;heritage and making common cause with&#xA;a disinherited prince against an all-&#xA;powerful king. If Ravana desired Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wife and carried her off, how does it&#xA;concern you? What do you lose by it?&#xA;Consider well and choose your course&#xA;with description. It is most expedient that&#xA;you and your army should return&#xA;forthwith to Kishkindha.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But Sugriva&amp;rsquo;s response was scornful&#xA;and definite:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Base fellow! Go and tell your king&#xA;that he is no brother of mine. He is wicked&#xA;and, being an enemy of my friend Rama,&#xA;he is my enemy too and we are out to rid&#xA;the world of him and his wicked gang. He&#xA;is a fool to imagine that he can offend&#xA;Rama and still survive. Tell him that there&#xA;is no escape for him, tell him all this as&#xA;from me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Sugriva delivered this message&#xA;to the Rakshasa spy the Vanaras caught&#xA;hold of him and began to handle him&#xA;roughly but Rama sternly forbade it and&#xA;set him free to go the way he came. The&#xA;spy rushed back to Lanka and conveyed&#xA;the result of his adventure to Ravana.&#xA;As soon as Vibhishana&amp;rsquo;s adherence was&#xA;accepted by Rama, Lakshmana and&#xA;Sugriva crowned Vibhishana king of&#xA;Lanka and performed the abhisheka with&#xA;seawater. Vibhishana pledged unchanging&#xA;friendship to Rama and Rama in turn gave&#xA;his word that he would not return to&#xA;Ayodhya without slaying Ravana.&#xA;Then&#xA;Sugriva,&#xA;Vibhishana&#xA;and&#xA;Lakshmana deliberated on how to cross&#xA;the sea. They thought it best to begin with&#xA;a prayer to the ocean-god and submitted&#xA;their opinion to Rama.&#xA;Rama accepted their counsel and,&#xA;spreading darbha grass on the seashore&#xA;and laying himself on it, began a fast,&#xA;addressing his request for a passage&#xA;across, to the king of the sea.&#xA;For three days he prayed to the god of&#xA;the sea but received no response. Then&#xA;Rama, his eyes glowing with anger at thesea-god&amp;rsquo;s arrogance, turned to Lakshmana&#xA;and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;The low-minded mistake courtesy and&#xA;gentleness for want of strength. Mildness&#xA;is simply wasted on them. See now how I&#xA;shall bring this misproud sea to its senses&#xA;with my arrows which shall not only&#xA;choke it with the carcasses of mighty fish&#xA;but even dry it up with their fierce odour.&#xA;Bring me my bow and quiver, O&#xA;Soumitra!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then bow in hand and blazing with&#xA;wrath like the destroying fire at the end of&#xA;the world he shot arrows irresistible as&#xA;thunderbolts into the bosom of the sea.&#xA;These missiles of power disturbed the sea&#xA;to its depths carrying death and dismay to&#xA;all it contained and presently the tortured&#xA;waters began to exhale steam in their&#xA;agony.&#xA;It looked as though Rama in his wrath&#xA;would convert the sea with its infinitude&#xA;of waters into a desert of blazing dust&#xA;bereft of all life. The sea-god could stand&#xA;it no longer. Shining like the rising sun&#xA;behind Mount Meru, he appeared and&#xA;stood before Rama.&#xA;With folded hands he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My Lord Ramachandra! I am subject&#xA;to the laws of nature like the earth, the air,&#xA;space, light, and all constituents of the&#xA;universe. How can I depart from my&#xA;nature, which is to be vast, deep, wave-&#xA;filled, and impassable? But this I can do.&#xA;Ask the Vanaras to bring boulders and&#xA;trees to build a causeway. I shall permit it.&#xA;I shall help you by receiving and keeping&#xA;in place the rocks and trees. This is all that&#xA;I can do and I shall also show the most&#xA;favorable place for this causeway. There&#xA;is Nala, son of Viswakarma, with you,&#xA;who has the ability to build this path. May&#xA;victory be yours.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama, true to his nature, graciously&#xA;accepted the sea god&amp;rsquo;s apology and offer&#xA;of help. And then, ordered by Rama, they&#xA;all began to work. Thousands of Vanaras&#xA;went at it with enthusiasm and soon&#xA;finished building the causeway.&#xA;Valmiki describes the work at length.&#xA;He sings with gusto of the noise and&#xA;confusion of the gigantic project. The&#xA;Vanaras went to the mountains and forests&#xA;and, plucking rocks and trees, dragged&#xA;them to the shore. The bigger Vanaras&#xA;brought big boulders and threw them into&#xA;the sea. As they fell down, the water&#xA;splashed up sky-high.&#xA;Nala stood and supervised their labors.&#xA;The leaders in charge of companies kept&#xA;them active. On top of the rocks and trees,&#xA;when the base was firm, a dressing of&#xA;grass and little pieces of wood was given&#xA;to produce a level surface. The noise&#xA;raised by the dam-builders drowned the&#xA;roar of the ocean.&#xA;The construction was complete. The&#xA;new path shone across the sea like the&#xA;milky way in the sky. Hosts of gods above&#xA;rejoiced, as hosts of Vanaras shouted&#xA;below in exultation. The gods and the&#xA;rishis uttered benedictions.&#xA;Then they went on the causeway.&#xA;Hanuman carried Rama on his shoulders&#xA;and Angada carried Lakshmana on his.&#xA;The Vanara army crossed the sea. There&#xA;is a principle expounded here. As Rama&#xA;stood bow in hand, the ocean-god bowed&#xA;before him with clasped bands and said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear Ramachandra! Earth, air, ether,&#xA;water, fire, these five elements must&#xA;follow the eternal laws of their nature.&#xA;Tempted by pleasure or reward or&#xA;frightened of punishment, can I ever&#xA;swerve from my nature? Can water harden&#xA;and become stone? Or can I reduce my&#xA;depths into a shallow pond for your easy&#xA;crossing?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus the ocean king protested with all&#xA;politeness to Sri Rama. Valmiki puts into&#xA;the mouth of the ocean king a&#xA;fundamental of our religious philosophy.He explains the primordial relationship&#xA;between God and Nature.&#xA;God&amp;rsquo;s law operates in and through&#xA;Nature. The laws of nature were created&#xA;so that the universe may proceed by itself.&#xA;So too the law of Karma. The five&#xA;elements, all objects without life as well&#xA;as all living creatures, must follow their&#xA;own permanent laws.&#xA;According to the Hindu Shastras,&#xA;Nature itself, the sequence and chain of&#xA;cause and effect, the properties of matter,&#xA;and the law of Karma, all are ordained&#xA;permanently by God.&#xA;Nature itself is a witness to God. He is&#xA;not proved by a suspension of the laws of&#xA;nature. This is expounded clearly in the&#xA;ninth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Under my supervision Nature gives&#xA;rise to all that exists movable and&#xA;immovable, and the universe, evolves&#xA;from this cause.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This is put briefly by Valmiki in the&#xA;speech of the ocean king. Malyavan, the&#xA;aged Rakshasa, tried his best to impress&#xA;on Ravana the error of his ways. He said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your time of good fortune is over.&#xA;Your sins have begun to bear their fruit&#xA;and to dim your radiance. You can trust&#xA;no longer the boons you have obtained&#xA;from the gods. Make peace with your&#xA;enemies. Look at the army that has&#xA;arrived, the terrible host of Vanaras and&#xA;bears. Look at this wonderful causeway so&#xA;quickly built. It seems to me, this Rama is&#xA;Vishnu himself come in human form.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana had no patience with such talk.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your words are wormwood in my ear,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he cried. &amp;ldquo;It looks as though you too have&#xA;joined my enemies. Are not human beings&#xA;well known to be weaklings? Why are you&#xA;afraid of this wretched man driven into the&#xA;forest by his father? And he relies on the&#xA;support of monkeys and bears! Of such a&#xA;man you are afraid.&#xA;Really I am ashamed of you. Or could&#xA;it be that you cannot bear to see me&#xA;happy? Why do you talk like this to me? I&#xA;cannot bend before Rama. If it is wrong&#xA;policy or wrong ethics, I cannot help it.&#xA;You may take it that it is part of my nature&#xA;and I cannot change it. I would far rather&#xA;die fighting than sue before Rama for&#xA;peace!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Malyavan replied: &amp;ldquo;Consider well and&#xA;do what you think best.&amp;rdquo; And he returned&#xA;home, uttering the usual benedictory&#xA;words: &amp;ldquo;Victory to the King! Victory to&#xA;Ravana!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The old man was Ravana&amp;rsquo;s grandfather.&#xA;Ravana&#xA;carefully&#xA;stationed&#xA;his&#xA;warriors. He posted Prahasta at the eastern&#xA;entrance, Mahaparsva and Mahodara at&#xA;the southern entrance and Indrajit, his&#xA;illustrious son, accomplished in the arts of&#xA;secret magic, at the western entrance,&#xA;while he decided himself to guard the&#xA;northern&#xA;entrance.&#xA;Virupaksha,&#xA;the&#xA;mighty, was appointed commander of the&#xA;army within the city.&#xA;Having ordered the disposition of his&#xA;forces and chief warriors, he felt he had&#xA;ensured victory. As his end was&#xA;approaching, he listened to no one and&#xA;foolishly believed himself unconquerable.&#xA;The ministers raised shouts of victory to&#xA;please the King and then dispersed.&#xA;Rama, Sugriva, Vibhishana and others&#xA;held a council of war. Vibhishana duly&#xA;laid before the council the information&#xA;gathered by scouts who had gone out and&#xA;watched Ravana&amp;rsquo;s arrangements.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;In numbers, strength and courage,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vibhishana said, &amp;ldquo;the army now mobilised&#xA;by Ravana surpasses that with which he&#xA;opposed Kubera. Still I have no doubt of&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s victory.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama distributed his forces to meet&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s disposition and assigned to each&#xA;commander the task he was to perform.&#xA;He ordered Nila to meet Prahasta at theeastern gate. Angada was to meet&#xA;Mahaparsva and Mahodara at the southern&#xA;entrance. At the western entrance&#xA;Hanuman was to encounter Indrajit, the&#xA;master of black magic.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana and I shall meet Ravana,&#xA;the terror of the world, and we shall direct&#xA;the assault on Lanka. Sugriva, Jambavan&#xA;and Vibhishana shall stay behind with our&#xA;main army.&amp;rdquo; The army rested for the&#xA;night on Mount Suvela. The following&#xA;morning, standing on the mountaintop,&#xA;they took a good look at Lanka.&#xA;The beautiful city on the summit of&#xA;Trikuta seemed as if suspended from the&#xA;sky. Behind the thick fortress wall the&#xA;Rakshasa army stood sentry, looking like&#xA;another massive wall. Observing the great&#xA;and beautiful buildings in Lanka, Rama&#xA;was moved to pity. And he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas! Because one person, drawn by&#xA;the noose of time, has committed a sin, all&#xA;this wealth and the whole Rakshasa race&#xA;must now be destroyed. Alas that this&#xA;scion of a noble race should forget his real&#xA;greatness and pull death and destruction&#xA;on himself and his people!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama continued: &amp;ldquo;However, we should&#xA;now bend all our thoughts to the task&#xA;before us to win this battle and destroy&#xA;Ravana. There will be much confusion in&#xA;the course of the battle. The Rakshasas&#xA;will try to deceive us with many disguises.&#xA;Let the Vanaras and bears retain their own&#xA;shape while fighting. Vibhishana and his&#xA;friends alone need assume human forms,&#xA;like Lakshmana and myself. The&#xA;Rakshasas, our enemies, will never take&#xA;the form of man or monkey. They would&#xA;think it beneath their dignity to do so. If&#xA;we stand together maintaining due order&#xA;we can know who is who, slay our&#xA;enemies and help our friends.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE Vanara army descended from&#xA;Mount Suvela and entered the forest&#xA;adjoining the city of Lanka. As the army&#xA;burst in like a flood the frightened beasts&#xA;and birds in the forest fled in all&#xA;directions.&#xA;Valmiki describes the scene and the&#xA;event in his characteristic style. Gazing&#xA;now from below at the mountain fortress&#xA;and the divinely beautiful city constructed&#xA;by Viswakarma, Rama was again filled&#xA;with wonder and exclaimed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Oh what beauty! What wealth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Vanaras, for their part, noted the&#xA;Rakshasa warriors&amp;rsquo; strength and readiness&#xA;for battle, the thick walls and mighty&#xA;engines of defence.&#xA;From Lanka, all ready for war, the&#xA;sounds of drums and trumpets issuing&#xA;from the city increased the eagerness of&#xA;the Vanaras for battle. The army stood in&#xA;ordered divisions as instructed by Rama.&#xA;Looking&#xA;at&#xA;Lanka&#xA;he&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana! Look at the beauty of the&#xA;city.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;His mind turned to Sita. She would&#xA;have known by now, he thought, of his&#xA;arrival with the army and her depressed&#xA;heart must have revived. But he spoke&#xA;nothing of this and engaged himself in the&#xA;arrangements for the army.&#xA;Suddenly, and without any noise or&#xA;warning to any one, Sugriva sprang up&#xA;into the sky and alighted on the terrace on&#xA;top of tower in Lanka, where he saw&#xA;Ravana seated clad in red royal robes like&#xA;a thick black cloud seen in the red evening&#xA;sky. The scar caused by the tusk of Indra&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;elephant, shone like a crescent moon on&#xA;his chest.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ravana! You are caught!&amp;rdquo; cried&#xA;Sugriva. &amp;ldquo;I am a friend and servant of&#xA;Rama. This is your last day!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And he sprang on him, knocked off his&#xA;crown and gave him a mighty blow. The&#xA;two wrestled together for a long time.&#xA;Both were experts in wrestling. All the&#xA;tricks of that science were tried by each.Ravana was at the end of his resources&#xA;and so he discarded wrestling and took to&#xA;magic&#xA;and&#xA;Sugriva&#xA;seeing&#xA;this&#xA;disentangled himself and sprang back to&#xA;where Rama was.&#xA;The Vanara leaders, who saw the son&#xA;of Surya return, shouted praises and made&#xA;a great noise of congratulations at this&#xA;daring-do, rash and reckless no doubt, but&#xA;such as would give the Rakshasas some&#xA;idea of the mettle of the foes they were up&#xA;against.&#xA;Rama too was glad to see that Sugriva&#xA;had returned safe. Observing bleeding&#xA;wounds on his body, he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Sugriva! I am filled with wonder and&#xA;joy at this, your valorous exploit. But&#xA;what you did was not right. It is not for a&#xA;king to rush into risks. How could you&#xA;suddenly and without consulting anyone&#xA;take such a dangerous course?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva confessed his fault.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;True, it was improper to rush into&#xA;battle without consulting you. But when I&#xA;saw the villain who had insulted Sita I&#xA;was overwhelmed by anger and forgot my&#xA;duty.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Vanara army surrounded Lanka on&#xA;all sides in the manner laid down by&#xA;Rama.&#xA;Rama sent for Angada and said to him:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Prince! Take this message from me to&#xA;Ravana. Tell him: &amp;lsquo;Great sinner, your end&#xA;is approaching. Rama waits at your&#xA;fortress gate, ready for battle. Trusting to&#xA;the boons of the gods, you have become&#xA;proud and wicked. You have troubled the&#xA;world too long and committed too many&#xA;heinous sins. The time has now come for&#xA;the world to be cleansed of you. If you&#xA;come out into the open and fight and die&#xA;in battle, your sins will be washed away&#xA;and you will gain a place in the world&#xA;above as a hero. But if you love your life,&#xA;humbly restore Sita to her lord and beg for&#xA;forgiveness. Then you can escape with&#xA;life. Whatever happens, you are fit to be&#xA;king no longer. The kingdom of Lanka&#xA;now belongs to Vibhishana. He is worthy&#xA;to rule and protect his people. If you are&#xA;not willing to surrender and seek safety,&#xA;then have your obsequies performed in&#xA;advance. Bid final farewell to all your&#xA;dear possessions in Lanka. Prepare for&#xA;death. Come out and meet Rama in battle.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Go, Angada, deliver this message to&#xA;Ravana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As instructed by Rama, bold Angada&#xA;delivered his message: &amp;ldquo;Listen, Ravana. I&#xA;am the son of Vali whom you no doubt&#xA;remember. I have come as Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;messenger. The time for your liberation&#xA;from sin has come. You may, if you&#xA;choose, die in battle and attain the swarga&#xA;of brave men, cleansed of your foul sins.&#xA;But if life is dear to you, you may beg it&#xA;of Rama after humble surrender, and he&#xA;never refuses mercy to a suppliant. If what&#xA;I have heard about you is true, you will&#xA;elect to fight, which means you choose to&#xA;die. I would advise you to take last leave&#xA;of your kinsfolk and complete your&#xA;obsequies yourself, for none of your race&#xA;will be left to perform them. Look your&#xA;last on lovely Lanka!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s rage flared up like a flame.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Seize him, kill him, the villain!&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;shouted.&#xA;At once, two Rakshasas caught hold of&#xA;Angada. He rose in the sky carrying these&#xA;two Rakshasas on either side of him and&#xA;then flung them down.&#xA;He rose higher up and, coming down&#xA;kicked and broke off the tower of the&#xA;king&amp;rsquo;s palace. Then with a single leap he&#xA;returned to where Rama was.&#xA;Dazed by Angada&amp;rsquo;s exploit, the&#xA;Rakshasas were filled with fear, but they&#xA;did not disclose it. Ravana, too, heaved a&#xA;heavy sigh at the sight of the broken&#xA;turret. He looked on it as a bad omen.As soon as Angada returned, Rama&#xA;issued orders to the army to begin the&#xA;assault on Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>68 SITA&#39;S JOY</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SUKA, the Rakshasa scout, went and&#xA;reported to Ravana: &amp;ldquo;I did my job&#xA;according to your instructions. But my&#xA;efforts were fruitless. They were rough&#xA;with me and made me feel thankful to be&#xA;allowed to come back. Rama, to whom it&#xA;was sport to slay Viradha, Kabandha,&#xA;Khara and others, has arrived with the&#xA;army of Sugriva. They have somehow&#xA;come to know of the place where Sita is&#xA;held captive. The bears and monkeys have&#xA;crossed the sea and are standing ready for&#xA;battle before Lanka. The visible earth is&#xA;covered with this army. There is nothing&#xA;to be gained by discussions and debates.&#xA;Their strife can only be quenched with our&#xA;blood, Oh King! Consider well what&#xA;needs to be done, and do it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And then he added with fear, in a&#xA;suppressed voice: &amp;ldquo;We may yet escape if&#xA;Sita is restored.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana was enraged. &amp;ldquo;What did you&#xA;say?&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;Let no one talk to me of&#xA;Sita being restored. They do not know my&#xA;strength who talk like this. I can slay the&#xA;gods, the Vanaras, the Gandharvas and the&#xA;Yakshas. My darts can burn up Indra&#xA;himself and Yama too. Wait and see how&#xA;this wretched fellow Rama and his army&#xA;will be destroyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana believed what he said. He had&#xA;dwelt long on his previous achievements&#xA;and, filled with pride, had become&#xA;foolishly obstinate.&#xA;Then he sent for two of his ministers&#xA;and told them: &amp;ldquo;Scouts have come and&#xA;reported that a large army has built a&#xA;causeway to Lanka and has come over&#xA;here. This is indeed strange news, but as&#xA;yet nothing serious has happened. Go and&#xA;observe the enemy and bring me a full and&#xA;detailed report of their strength.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, the spies assumed the&#xA;shape of Vanaras and coming to Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;camp and mixing with the other Vanaras&#xA;looked all around. But Vibhishana,&#xA;discovering their disguise, caught hold of&#xA;them and produced them before Rama.&#xA;They pleaded that they were mere&#xA;messengers sent by their king and prayed&#xA;for release.&#xA;Rama said: &amp;ldquo;Show them our army. Let&#xA;them have a good look around before they&#xA;return. Give them free and full&#xA;opportunity to see our strength. And, Oh&#xA;you Rakshasa messengers! When you go&#xA;back to Ravana, tell him, &amp;lsquo;The strength on&#xA;which you relied when you carried Sita&#xA;away is to be put now to the test. Your&#xA;fortress, your city and your army will be&#xA;destroyed, Rama&amp;rsquo;s darts will pierce your&#xA;body.&amp;rsquo; Yes, convey this message to your&#xA;king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The spies heard Rama&amp;rsquo;s words and&#xA;agreed to convey them to their master.&#xA;Then, impelled perhaps by force of habit,&#xA;they said: &amp;ldquo;Victory to thee!&amp;rdquo; The Vanara&#xA;army took this to be a fine omen.&#xA;The spies went back to Ravana and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;O King! We were discovered by&#xA;Vibhishana and were in fear of death but&#xA;Rama would not let them kill us and he&#xA;ordered our release. King! Our enemies&#xA;are determined. Rama and Lakshmana,&#xA;Sugriva the Vanara king and Vibhishana,&#xA;they are all of one mind. It is difficult for&#xA;us to prevail against an army led by such&#xA;warriors. We have seen Rama, son of&#xA;Dasaratha. He impressed us as being by&#xA;himself strong enough to destroy our city&#xA;and army. We have seen the courage of&#xA;the Vanaras and their eagerness for battle.&#xA;It is not expedient to try the fortune of war&#xA;with them. It seems best to restore Sita to&#xA;Rama. Do consider what should be done.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Of course the advice was sincere and&#xA;well meant, but Ravana could not control&#xA;his fury. He said: &amp;ldquo;Even if the wholeworld turns against me, I shall not yield to&#xA;fear. Even if all the Devas, Gandharvas&#xA;and Vanaras join together to oppose me, I&#xA;shall not return Sita. Because you were&#xA;thrashed by the enemy, you give me this&#xA;cowardly advice. Faint hearts! Where is&#xA;the foe who can vanquish me?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Having said this, he went to his high&#xA;tower and himself surveyed the enemy&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;strength. His ministers and officers were&#xA;with him.&#xA;Those who had gone out to reconnoitre&#xA;described at length the Vanara chiefs and&#xA;the army behind them. They recounted the&#xA;strength of that huge army of bears and&#xA;monkeys gathered together from the far-&#xA;flung forests, mountains and river-valleys&#xA;of the world.&#xA;They spoke of their physical strength&#xA;and courage, their firm devotion to Rama,&#xA;their unity and eagerness to slay the&#xA;Rakshasas. All those that had gone&#xA;confirmed this.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look!&amp;rdquo; one of them&#xA;said. &amp;ldquo;That majestic and graceful youth&#xA;with matted locks and bow in hand is&#xA;Rama. See how he looks round him with&#xA;eyes of love and command and how his&#xA;glances seem to brighten the quarters and&#xA;to fill all with devotion and confidence.&#xA;The mighty armed warrior near him is his&#xA;brother Lakshmana, a peerless bowman&#xA;and Rama&amp;rsquo;s second soul. And look! Next&#xA;to him is Sugriva, wearing Vali&amp;rsquo;s garland.&#xA;He is the equal of Vali himself. There,&#xA;next to him you see Vibhishana, your&#xA;brother. It is not easy to vanquish such&#xA;warriors. Consider well and take all steps&#xA;necessary for victory in such a situation.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As the ministers extolled the strength&#xA;of the enemy, Ravana&amp;rsquo;s rage grew more&#xA;and more furious. This is the way of a&#xA;tyrant. The wise king is never angry with&#xA;those who bring him true information or&#xA;with ministers who give him good advice&#xA;for his welfare. But now Ravana&amp;rsquo;s mind&#xA;was confused. He had no use for true facts&#xA;or good advice.&#xA;His thought followed a strange line. He&#xA;judged Rama by his own character. He&#xA;thought that, if Sita could be made&#xA;somehow to yield to him, Rama would&#xA;return home disgraced and broken&#xA;hearted. Hence be resolved to make one&#xA;last attempt with a different technique.&#xA;He sought the help of a Rakshasa&#xA;sorcerer. &amp;ldquo;Oh, Lightning-Tongue!&amp;rdquo; he said&#xA;(that was his name), &amp;ldquo;prepare a head&#xA;which looks so exactly like Rama&amp;rsquo;s that it&#xA;will deceive Rama&amp;rsquo;s nearest and dearest&#xA;into believing it is his. When I send for&#xA;you, come to the park where Sita is&#xA;incarcerated and place it before her.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The sorcerer agreed to do as he was&#xA;bidden.&#xA;Then Ravana went once again to the&#xA;Asoka Park and tried to beguile Sita.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your husband and his army have been&#xA;destroyed.&amp;rdquo; be said. &amp;ldquo;My warriors crossed&#xA;the sea and attacking Rama and his&#xA;monkeys, when they were tired and&#xA;asleep, killed them all. A warrior has&#xA;brought the head of your husband for me&#xA;to see. Why do you still persist in your&#xA;obstinacy? Join my wives now and reign&#xA;as their chief. Take my advice and&#xA;become the queen of Lanka.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then he ordered a Rakshasa to fetch&#xA;Vidyut-Jihva, the sorcerer. The conjurer&#xA;came and placed before Sita a head that&#xA;looked exactly like Rama&amp;rsquo;s.&#xA;Startled by the sight, Sita cried, &amp;ldquo;So&#xA;then, is this my fate?&amp;rdquo; and broke into&#xA;hopeless lamentation.&#xA;Meanwhile, Rama&amp;rsquo;s army had come&#xA;close to Lanka and the ministers and&#xA;generals sent word to Ravana desiring an&#xA;immediate interview. Ravana, therefore,&#xA;had to leave Sita at once and go to the&#xA;Assembly Hall.&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s presence was necessary to&#xA;keep up the sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s illusion. So, whenhe left the place, the, apparition of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;head vanished like smoke. Sarama, who&#xA;was a lady of the royal household posted&#xA;as a companion of Sita, consoled her&#xA;explaining the illusion. She said: &amp;ldquo;No one&#xA;has killed Rama. He has reached Lanka at&#xA;the head of a great army. They have built&#xA;a wonderful causeway across the sea and&#xA;are all over Lanka like a submerging sea.&#xA;The Rakshasas are panic-stricken. Ravana&#xA;is only trying to deceive you through&#xA;sorcery.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sarama went on to inform Sita:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Several ministers advised Ravana to&#xA;restore you and save himself by&#xA;unconditional submission. But he would&#xA;not listen to them. &amp;lsquo;I may perish in battle,&amp;rsquo;&#xA;he said, &amp;lsquo;but I will not bow, a suppliant&#xA;before Rama. I shall never return Sita and&#xA;sue for peace.&amp;rsquo; Holy lady! No harm can&#xA;come to you, Rama will surely triumph&#xA;and this wicked one will perish.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Even as Sarama was speaking, the&#xA;noise of the drums and trumpets sounded&#xA;by the Vanara army reached Sita&amp;rsquo;s ears&#xA;and filled her with joy. She knew that&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s end was near. The Rakshasas in&#xA;Lanka heard the same noise and trembled&#xA;in fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAVANA as duly informed that&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s Vanara host surrounded Lanka&#xA;like a tumultuous sea. In an angry mood&#xA;he went up the tower of his mansion and&#xA;surveyed the scene. On every side he saw&#xA;Vanara warriors who had armed&#xA;themselves with trees and boulders. He&#xA;wondered how he could destroy this vast&#xA;invading force.&#xA;At the same time, Rama saw the City&#xA;of Lanka guarded by the Rakshasas. He&#xA;could see with his mind&amp;rsquo;s eye the sad&#xA;figure of Sita held captive within those&#xA;walls. He ordered an immediate assault.&#xA;Shouting: &amp;ldquo;Victory to the Vanara king!&#xA;Victory to Rama and Lakshmana! Polish&#xA;off the Rakshasas,&amp;rdquo; the Vanara army&#xA;rushed on the doomed city. Some hurled&#xA;big boulders against the fortress wall and&#xA;on the city gates. Others armed with huge&#xA;trees torn up by the roots rushed on the&#xA;Rakshasas.&#xA;Then Ravana sent forth a big army. He&#xA;commanded it to go out and slay at once&#xA;all the Vanaras. They beat their drums and&#xA;blew their trumpets till the sky resounded.&#xA;They fell upon the Vanaras. The Vanaras&#xA;used boulders and trees and their own&#xA;nails and fists to oppose the Rakshasas.&#xA;Thousands fell dead on either side. The&#xA;field was covered with blood and mangled&#xA;bodies.&#xA;Besides this gruesome engagement,&#xA;there were many duels between individual&#xA;warriors. Angada encountered Indrajit like&#xA;Rudra against Yama. There was a duel&#xA;between the Rakshasa Prajangha and&#xA;Sampati, one of the companions of&#xA;Vibhishana. Hanuman fought a duel with&#xA;Jambumali,&#xA;Nila&#xA;with&#xA;Nikumbha,&#xA;Lakshmana with Viroopaksha, and so on.&#xA;The chariot and horses of Indrajit were&#xA;destroyed and Angada received a blow&#xA;from the mace of Indrajit. Jambumali hit&#xA;Hanuman with his weapon and Hanuman&#xA;smashed his chariot to pieces. The&#xA;Rakshasas concentrated their attack on&#xA;Rama, and fell in thousands under his&#xA;arrows.&#xA;Vidyunmali aimed his darts at Sushena.&#xA;The latter smashed with a rock the chariot&#xA;of the Rakshasa. Vidyunmali jumped out&#xA;with his mace and attacked Sushena who&#xA;crushed him to death with a rock. In this&#xA;way many warriors fought and many died.&#xA;The battle raged throughout the day.&#xA;And at night the Rakshasas would not stop&#xA;fighting. The battle became fierce. Blood&#xA;flowed in streams. There was terrible&#xA;slaughter on both sides. Angada attacked&#xA;Indrajit, slew his horses and charioteer&#xA;and smashed the chariot. The Vanarasadmired the skill and strength of their&#xA;prince and raised shouts of joy.&#xA;All the warriors in the army praised the&#xA;Vanara prince&amp;rsquo;s prowess. Indrajit lost his&#xA;temper along with his chariot and resorted&#xA;to sorcery. Making himself invisible he&#xA;aimed many darts at Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana who were greatly harassed at&#xA;this attack from a foe whose whereabouts&#xA;no one could discover and who seemed to&#xA;shower deadly missiles from all sides.&#xA;Then Indrajit shot serpent darts at&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana. Bound by them,&#xA;they could not move and lay helpless on&#xA;the battlefield. They looked at one&#xA;another,&#xA;wondering&#xA;what&#xA;to&#xA;do.&#xA;Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s grief at Rama&amp;rsquo;s plight was&#xA;great. As for the Vanaras they stood round&#xA;in mournful bewilderment.&#xA;Indrajit congratulated the Rakshasa&#xA;army and returned to the city. Exulting in&#xA;his victory, he went to his father and&#xA;announced that the story of Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana was over. Ravana was beside&#xA;himself with joy. He embraced his son&#xA;and praised his prowess.&#xA;The Vanara warriors wounded and&#xA;downcast, seeing Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;laid low, concluded that all was over.&#xA;Vibhishana, who saw Sugriva standing&#xA;helpless and forlorn, put courage in the&#xA;Vanara king. &amp;ldquo;It is foolish to lose hope,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said. &amp;ldquo;Look at Rama and Lakshmana.&#xA;Their faces are still bright. They are not&#xA;dead. Be not afraid. Soon they will&#xA;recover from this swoon and resume&#xA;fighting.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The chief took heart and did everything&#xA;to save the army from panic. The ranks&#xA;were reformed with their respective&#xA;chiefs.&#xA;Meanwhile Ravana had it&#xA;proclaimed in Lanka that Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana had been slain by Indrajit. He&#xA;sent for his women and said to them: &amp;ldquo;Go&#xA;at once and inform Sita that Rama is no&#xA;more; that the two princes lie dead on the&#xA;battlefield and the Vanara army is&#xA;destroyed. Also, to convince her finally,&#xA;take her in the Pushpaka Vimana and&#xA;show her the battlefield from above. Let&#xA;the obstinate one see for herself what has&#xA;happened. Seeing that she has now no one&#xA;to look to besides myself, she will turn to&#xA;me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The Rakshasis did as they were told.&#xA;From the Vimana Sita saw the field of&#xA;battle. She saw Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;lying motionless on the ground with their&#xA;weapons scattered by their side. She was&#xA;filled with grief. She thought that it was&#xA;now all over and cried: &amp;ldquo;To this end has&#xA;fate brought me, giving the lie to the&#xA;predictions of saints and astrologers that I&#xA;would live as a happy wife and mother&#xA;and a glorious queen. Poor Kausalya!&#xA;Who shall console you now. Like one&#xA;who, having, crossed the ocean, gets&#xA;drowned in a little pond, these warriors,&#xA;who had done so much, lie dead now. Oh&#xA;princes! How did your divine weapons&#xA;fail you. Alas, all-powerful is destiny!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When Sita was thus in the desperation&#xA;of utter sorrow, Trijata, her Rakshasi&#xA;companion, who was looking closely at&#xA;the motionless figures of the princes,&#xA;suddenly burst out: &amp;ldquo;Dear Sita, there is no&#xA;cause for grief. Neither your husband nor&#xA;Lakshmana is dead. Look at their faces. Is&#xA;this how the dead look? They are bound&#xA;by a charmed weapon and are&#xA;unconscious for a while. Look at the&#xA;orderly array of the army. Have courage.&#xA;Be not frightened.&amp;rdquo; Her words fell like&#xA;nectar in Sita&amp;rsquo;s ears. The Vimana returned&#xA;to Lanka and Sita was taken back to the&#xA;Asoka Vana.&#xA;In time the force of the arrows charged&#xA;with sorcery weakened. Rama opened his&#xA;eyes and sat up. Though sorely wounded,&#xA;he recovered his strength by an exercise of&#xA;will power and sat up. He looked at his&#xA;brother lying on the ground and cried out:&amp;ldquo;Alas! What is the use of victory now for&#xA;me? Why did I bring you, dear brother,&#xA;with me to the forest and get you killed&#xA;like this? How can I return without you to&#xA;Ayodhya? You used ever to console me in&#xA;my sorrow. You are silent now when I&#xA;face the greatest sorrow. How can I&#xA;survive you? Where in the world is a&#xA;warrior like you? One can replace&#xA;anything lost, but where can I find anyone&#xA;to fill your place? Like Kartaviryarjuna&#xA;with his thousand hands, you with your&#xA;two hands discharged showers of arrows&#xA;and slew the Rakshasas. How could death&#xA;come to you? You came with me into the&#xA;forest, and now I shall repay my debt to&#xA;you by joining with you to the abode of&#xA;Yama. I confess defeat. The word I gave&#xA;to Vibhishana cannot be fulfilled. Oh&#xA;Vanara king! Return to Kishkindha with&#xA;all your warriors. You have worked hard&#xA;for me. You have fulfilled all the duties of&#xA;friendship. You have my gratitude. But&#xA;there is no use in more of you dying. Go&#xA;back to your city. Let me perish here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus did Rama lament in helpless grief.&#xA;Then Vibhishana arrived there, mace in&#xA;hand. Seeing his huge dark form, the&#xA;Vanaras imagined it was Indrajit again&#xA;and started to fly.&#xA;In another part of the battlefield&#xA;Sugriva and Angada were discussing.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why are the Vanaras thus beginning to&#xA;scatter in fear? What has happened?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;asked Sugriva.&#xA;Angada answered, &amp;ldquo;Do you not know&#xA;that Rama and Lakshmana are lying&#xA;wounded?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva said: &amp;ldquo;It is not that. Look at the&#xA;way they are running helter-skelter. There&#xA;must be some other reason for it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then he learnt that the Vanaras, who&#xA;had suffered at the hands of Indrajit,&#xA;mistook Vibhishana for him and were&#xA;frightened. He sent Jambavan to rally the&#xA;troops by disabusing them of this fear.&#xA;Vibhishana&#xA;looked&#xA;at&#xA;Rama&#xA;and&#xA;Lakshmana. When he saw them wounded,&#xA;covered with arrows all over, and unable&#xA;to fight, he broke down crying: &amp;ldquo;It is all&#xA;over. What more is there to do?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sugriva turned to Sushena, his uncle,&#xA;and said: &amp;ldquo;Take Rama and Lakshmana to&#xA;Kishkindha. I shall kill Ravana, redeem&#xA;Sita, and bring her there.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sushena answered: &amp;ldquo;There are herbs&#xA;which can heal the wounds of the princes&#xA;and restore them to health. Some of us&#xA;know where these herbs are to be found.&#xA;Here is Hanuman. If you send him, he will&#xA;fetch the herbs.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;As they were speaking, the sea and air&#xA;were churned up by a mighty wind and&#xA;the great bird Garuda burst into view.&#xA;When Garuda arrived, the serpent darts&#xA;that covered Rama and Lakshmana&#xA;disappeared instantaneously. They were&#xA;all venomous serpents which had become&#xA;arrows through the magic of Indrajit and&#xA;had bound the princes&amp;rsquo; bodies.&#xA;When their inveterate and dreaded&#xA;enemy Garuda appeared, they took flight.&#xA;Then Garuda gently stroked the bodies of&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana and restored to&#xA;them their full strength. The wounds were&#xA;all healed and they rose up, stronger and&#xA;more radiant than before.&#xA;And Rama asked: &amp;ldquo;Who are you, my&#xA;benefactor?&amp;rdquo; He did not know that he was&#xA;Vishnu and Garuda was his own bird on&#xA;which he always rode.&#xA;Garuda answered, &amp;ldquo;I am your good&#xA;friend, and old companion. Glory is&#xA;yours! Let me go now. When the battle is&#xA;ended, we shall know each other better.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Saying thus Hamsa bird flew away.&#xA;Seeing Rama and Lakshmana fully&#xA;recovered and ready for battle, the&#xA;Vanaras were enthusiastic once again and&#xA;resumed attacking Ravana&amp;rsquo;s fortress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RAVANA from within his palace was&#xA;surprised to hear, borne on the wind, the&#xA;jubilant acclamations of the Vanaras, who&#xA;he thought must then be mourning their&#xA;vanquished&#xA;leaders&#xA;and&#xA;slaughtered&#xA;comrades. He turned to the Rakshasas&#xA;standing beside him and asked: &amp;ldquo;What has&#xA;happened to make the Vanaras so happy?&#xA;Something strange must have occurred.&#xA;Go and find out what it is.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Some Rakshasas climbed up and&#xA;looked over the wall. Returning, they said&#xA;to Ravana with fear and trembling: &amp;ldquo;King!&#xA;The Vanara army, led by Sugriva, is&#xA;attacking the fortress with spirit. Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana are both alive. Like&#xA;elephants that have broken their bonds,&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana have shaken off the&#xA;naga darts with which Indrajit bound them&#xA;and have rejoined the army and are raging&#xA;about the field like hungry lions. The darts&#xA;of Indrajit have proved futile.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s face fell. He was filled with&#xA;anxiety and said: &amp;ldquo;I marvel at what you&#xA;say. No one till now has escaped these&#xA;darts. If those weapons were powerless&#xA;against these men, we are in deed in&#xA;danger.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then with an access of anger, he&#xA;shouted: &amp;ldquo;Listen, Dhumraksha! Why&#xA;should I worry when you are here? Get&#xA;together all the men you want. Go at once&#xA;and destroy these two little men and return&#xA;quickly.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Dhumraksha was indeed happy and&#xA;proud to be thus singled out by the king.&#xA;He took a party of warriors and, issuing&#xA;out of the fort, came into contact with the&#xA;group who, under Hanuman, were&#xA;attempting to enter the western gate. In&#xA;the battle that ensued there was great&#xA;slaughter on both sides. In the end&#xA;Dhumraksha was slain by Hanuman. A&#xA;few Rakshasas escaped into the fortress,&#xA;but most of them lay dead without.&#xA;News of this discomfiture filled&#xA;Ravana with uncontrollable fury. He&#xA;hastily summoned Vajradamshtra and&#xA;said: &amp;ldquo;Oh bravest of warriors, go without&#xA;delay and destroy these wicked fellows.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vajradamshtra bowed low before the&#xA;king and followed by a mighty army&#xA;sallied out of the southern gate and&#xA;encountered Angada.&#xA;The Rakshasas under the leadership of&#xA;Vajradamshtra waged grim battle and&#xA;slew countless Vanaras. And yet the&#xA;Vanara army stood firm and would not&#xA;withdraw. Armed with boulders and trees,&#xA;they killed innumerable Rakshasas. On&#xA;both sides the fighting was intense. In the&#xA;end, Angada and the Rakshasa chief&#xA;fought hand to hand for a long while.&#xA;Vajradamshtra&#xA;was&#xA;slain,&#xA;gallantly&#xA;fighting to the last, and the Rakshasas fled&#xA;in confusion. The Vanaras surrounded&#xA;Angada and shouted in exultation.&#xA;Then Ravana ordered Prahasta: &amp;ldquo;Send&#xA;Akampana and let him have the most&#xA;terrible Rakshasas to accompany him. Let&#xA;them go and slay Rama, Sugriva and the&#xA;Vanara army. None can resist Akampana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;might and skill.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, Prahasta sent an army of&#xA;Rakshasas under the leadership of&#xA;Akampana. True to his name, Akampana&#xA;was firm and immovable in battle. He had&#xA;chosen his weapons and his warriors&#xA;carefully. As he advanced, bad omens met&#xA;him. But neither he nor his followers&#xA;regarded them. The noise of their&#xA;challenge rose above that of the ocean.&#xA;A great battle ensued. Blood flowed in&#xA;streams. Dust rose and cut off the sun&#xA;plunging the earth in portentous gloom.&#xA;The slaughter on both sides was&#xA;enormous. Kumuda, Nala, Mainda and&#xA;Dwivida&#xA;attacked&#xA;Akampana&#xA;who&#xA;defended himself with courage.&#xA;The battle went against the Vanara&#xA;warriors and they were about to take flightwhen Hanuman arrived bringing courage&#xA;and hope. Akampana sent forth a shower&#xA;of arrows at him but Hanuman took no&#xA;notice and lifting a huge boulder and&#xA;swinging it above his head hurled it at&#xA;Akampana.&#xA;The&#xA;Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;darts&#xA;intercepted the stone and reduced it to&#xA;powder.&#xA;Then Hanuman grew in size and shone&#xA;with blinding brightness like the sun and&#xA;uprooting a big tree attacked the Rakshasa&#xA;with it and slew him. The Rakshasa army&#xA;was smashed like a forest in an earthquake&#xA;and the survivors fled in panic from the&#xA;fatal field that was strewn thick with the&#xA;dead, and spread the dismal news in&#xA;Lanka. The Vanaras surrounded Hanuman&#xA;and&#xA;uproariously&#xA;expressed&#xA;their&#xA;admiration.&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s spirits fell when he received&#xA;the news of Akampana&amp;rsquo;s death but he&#xA;found strength in anger and desperation&#xA;and began thinking of new plans. He went&#xA;round the defences of the city again and&#xA;took&#xA;counsel&#xA;with&#xA;Prahasta,&#xA;the&#xA;commander-in chief.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We must break this Vanara siege. We&#xA;should issue at the head of the whole army&#xA;and slay the Vanara chiefs. Myself,&#xA;Kumbhakarna,&#xA;yourself,&#xA;Indrajit&#xA;or&#xA;Nikumbha, one of us five should take up&#xA;the responsibility of leading the army out&#xA;of the fortress. Are we to be afraid of&#xA;monkeys? Why! They used to flee in&#xA;terror on merely hearing the roar of a&#xA;Rakshasa. They do not know the science&#xA;of war. They are unskilled brutes. How&#xA;have they managed to stand all our&#xA;attacks?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Prahasta answered humbly: &amp;ldquo;Things&#xA;have happened as we foresaw. We&#xA;respectfully submitted long ago that it&#xA;would be best to restore Sita and make&#xA;peace. But I am bound to obey you. I am&#xA;prepared to sacrifice my life, my family,&#xA;my all for your sake. I shall lead this&#xA;sortie, if such is your pleasure.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A huge army was collected and&#xA;everything was got ready for a supreme&#xA;endeavor, including the solemnisation of&#xA;special rites and sacrifices.&#xA;Then Prahasta marched out to the&#xA;beating of drums. Evil omens presented&#xA;themselves. But he disregarded them.&#xA;Seeing the great army led by Prahasta&#xA;issuing out of the eastern gate of the&#xA;fortress, the Vanaras roared with joy and&#xA;prepared for battle.&#xA;Like moths rushing at a flame, the&#xA;Rakshasas fell on the Vanara army.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look,&amp;rdquo; said Rama, &amp;ldquo;there comes out a&#xA;Rakshasa at the head of an enormous&#xA;army. Who is he?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Vibhishana replied: &amp;ldquo;It is Prahasta, the&#xA;commander-in-chief of Ravana. A third of&#xA;the imperial army is his to command.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then ensued a grim battle between the&#xA;Vanaras armed with boulders and trees&#xA;and the Rakshasa equipped with swords,&#xA;spears, bows and axes. Exchanging&#xA;showers of stones for arrows and&#xA;grappling in death grips at close quarters,&#xA;both sides fought fiercely, deluging the&#xA;field with blood.&#xA;Prahasta&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;followers,&#xA;Narantaka,&#xA;Mahanada, Kumbhahanu and others were&#xA;opposed by Dwivida, Durmukha and&#xA;Jambavan and stain. There was a&#xA;prolonged battle between Prahasta and&#xA;Nila. At last Prahasta, armed with a&#xA;massive mace of iron rushed towards Nila.&#xA;Nila, for his part, uprooted a big boulder&#xA;and with it smashed Prahasta&amp;rsquo;s head&#xA;killing him on the spot.&#xA;The Rakshasa warriors fled in all&#xA;directions. After this great victory, Nila&#xA;went to Rama, and Lakshmana and,&#xA;bowing low, told them what happened.&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana praised his prowess&#xA;and congratulated him.Some of those who fled from the battle&#xA;carried to the Rakshasa King the news that&#xA;Nila, son of Agni, had slain Prahasta.&#xA;Ravana was beside himself with rage and&#xA;grief. &amp;ldquo;My warrior chief,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;who&#xA;could vanquish Indra and his host of gods,&#xA;has been killed by these Vanaras. We&#xA;cannot treat this lightly. We must destroy&#xA;Rama and the monkey host.&amp;rdquo; So saying,&#xA;Ravana got into his chariot and went&#xA;forward like Rudra, the destroyer. Seated&#xA;in his radiant chariot and issuing from the&#xA;city, Ravana beheld the Vanara army and&#xA;heard their uproar which resounded like&#xA;the ocean.&#xA;Seeing a new Rakshasa army issuing&#xA;out, the Vanaras stood ready to receive&#xA;them with stones and trees in hand.&#xA;Vibhishana pointed out the Rakshasa&#xA;warriors one by one to Rama. &amp;ldquo;There&#xA;seated in the chariot and shining like the&#xA;rising sun, is Indrajit.&amp;rdquo; And so he went on&#xA;from one renowned warrior to another till&#xA;he came to Ravana. &amp;ldquo;There, in the big&#xA;chariot, radiant like the sun, sits the ten-&#xA;headed Ravana.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama beheld the majestic and glowing&#xA;form with interest and pity. &amp;ldquo;A great&#xA;warrior no doubt,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;but he is so&#xA;wicked that he has to be slain.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana attacked innumerable Vanaras&#xA;and laid them low. Nila opposed Ravana&#xA;gallantly but was felled by a fire-dart.&#xA;Hanuman attacked Ravana with violence&#xA;and the two fought an equal battle for a&#xA;while but Ravana could not be subdued&#xA;and wrought great havoc in the Vanara&#xA;host.&#xA;There was a fight between Lakshmana&#xA;and Ravana. Lakshmana fell down&#xA;unconscious but Hanuman intervened and&#xA;carried Lakshmana away to Rama.&#xA;Then Rama, riding on Hanuman&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;shoulders, gave battle to Ravana. The&#xA;Rakshasa king was sorely wounded. His&#xA;olden crown was broken. So was his&#xA;chariot. Deprived of every weapon, he&#xA;stood before Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You may go now,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. &amp;ldquo;You&#xA;have fought well today. Go away and rest&#xA;and come back tomorrow, refreshed and&#xA;with weapons.&amp;rdquo; And Ravana retreated&#xA;shamefacedly to the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WHEN Ravana returned humbled and&#xA;dejected, the gods rejoiced foreseeing the&#xA;speedy end of their troubles. Ravana&#xA;entered the fortress, ashamed and anxious.&#xA;After deliberating a while, he recovered&#xA;his courage and ordered his sleeping&#xA;brother Kumbhakarna to be roused.&#xA;As the result of a curse, Kumbhakarna&#xA;used to sleep for months together and he&#xA;had gone to sleep just a few days before&#xA;the events last narrated. Ravana asked his&#xA;ministers to spare no efforts to rouse&#xA;Kumbhakarna at once and get him ready&#xA;for battle.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;All my penances have proved futile. It&#xA;looks as though the prophecy of the rishis&#xA;will be fulfilled,&amp;rdquo; thus said Ravana to&#xA;himself, but rooted in his determination to&#xA;fight to the last he issued orders as if he&#xA;were certain of ultimate success: &amp;ldquo;Let the&#xA;warriors guard the fortress on all sides.&#xA;My brother is sound asleep. He sleeps&#xA;blissfully, unaware of my anxiety. He will&#xA;not wake up for months together if left&#xA;alone. It is only nine days since he started&#xA;sleeping. Rouse him at once. If he wakes&#xA;up and goes to the battle, the enemy will&#xA;be surely scattered. Who can stand before&#xA;my Kumbhakarna? If he wakes up and&#xA;opposes my enemies in battle, I need have&#xA;no fear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s officers and their servants&#xA;accordingly went to Kumbhakarna&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;palace. They knew that as soon as he&#xA;opened his eyes, he would be rapaciously&#xA;hungry. So they first prepared and piled&#xA;up mountains of food for him. Then theymade a great din beating drums and&#xA;blowing conches.&#xA;Many Rakshasas exhausted themselves&#xA;pushing and shaking the huge body of the&#xA;Rakshasa. The noise that they made with&#xA;their shouts and drums and trumpets filled&#xA;the sky and frightened all the birds and&#xA;beasts of Lanka, but Kumbhakarna in his&#xA;sleep heard nothing. The Rakshasas&#xA;worked hard at rousing him. They made&#xA;elephants walk on his body. They took&#xA;cudgels and belabored him.&#xA;At last his eyelids opened slightly and&#xA;as one might brush away a mosquito while&#xA;still asleep he pushed them all aside and&#xA;yawned.&#xA;Kumbhakarna was thus&#xA;disturbed in his sleep which otherwise&#xA;would have been months long.&#xA;But before be could find out the cause&#xA;for this, he began to eat and drink. The&#xA;heaps of meat and the pots of blood and&#xA;wine kept ready for him were finished.&#xA;When his hunger was somewhat mitigated&#xA;the Rakshasas approached him to acquaint&#xA;him with the situation.&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s minister Yupaksha said: &amp;ldquo;My&#xA;Lord, we have been defeated in battle and&#xA;stand in grave danger. You will remember&#xA;the quarrel about Sita. The Vanaras with&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana have arrived and&#xA;are breaking through the fort. They have&#xA;slaughtered and defeated our army which&#xA;never knew defeat before. Lanka is&#xA;surrounded by the Vanara host as by an&#xA;ocean. Ravana himself went to battle but&#xA;he retired from the field having had the&#xA;worst of it. It was our good luck that he&#xA;escaped with life.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hearing this, Kumbhakarna was beside&#xA;himself with rage. &amp;ldquo;This very instant I&#xA;shall go and destroy this enemy. I shall&#xA;kill the Vanaras and drink the blood of&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana. After finishing this&#xA;first, I shall go and wait on the king.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The ministers were delighted to hear&#xA;this furious speech but pleaded with&#xA;Kumbhakarna that he should first see the&#xA;King and take counsel with him as to what&#xA;should be done.&#xA;Kumbhakarna agreed, washed his face&#xA;and then strode in sombre majesty to the&#xA;hall of the king of Lanka.&#xA;The Rakshasas standing on the royal&#xA;highway felt new courage and joy as they&#xA;saw him pass and bowed low before him&#xA;and showered flowers on him. He entered&#xA;the palace and stood in the presence of&#xA;Ravana. Rejoicing at the arrival of his&#xA;peerless brother, Ravana stepped down&#xA;from his throne and embraced him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What can I do for you, brother?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;asked Kumbhakarna. &amp;ldquo;Why did you get&#xA;my sleep broken? What makes you afraid?&#xA;Tell me who is tired of life and wants to&#xA;be turned into a corpse!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Brother! You do not know what has&#xA;happened,&amp;rdquo; said Ravana. &amp;ldquo;You were lost&#xA;in sleep. The man Rama has become a real&#xA;menace to me. He has built a dam across&#xA;the sea we considered inviolate and now&#xA;the Vanara army surrounds Lanka like&#xA;another sea. Our warriors who sortied out&#xA;and met them have been defeated and&#xA;almost annihilated. It is for you now to&#xA;save us from destruction and I know you&#xA;can do it. You have put the gods to rout. I&#xA;know your love for me. I know your&#xA;keenness and your courage in battle. Go at&#xA;once and annihilate these enemies and&#xA;help us in our need and save Lanka.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kumbhakarna, when he heard Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;words of anxiety, was moved at first to&#xA;fury against the enemy but soon he&#xA;remembered the whole story and Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;vainglorious&#xA;confidence&#xA;in&#xA;his&#xA;invincibility and that made him smile a&#xA;little bitterly.&#xA;He said: &amp;ldquo;Excuse me, my brother. The&#xA;warning we gave you when you consulted&#xA;us went unheeded. Our fears have come&#xA;true. You rejected the good advice we&#xA;gave you. Now, you suffer theconsequences of your error and your sin.&#xA;You brought away Sita. What else can&#xA;happen when, driven by lust, one acts&#xA;without thinking. If you so desired, and&#xA;you had the confidence and strength, it&#xA;would have been wise first to have slain&#xA;Rama and Lakshmana and then seized her.&#xA;You have done things without due thought&#xA;and in the wrong order. When one acts&#xA;without seeking or regarding the advice of&#xA;wise and faithful friends and kinsmen, it is&#xA;no wonder if he runs into danger and ruin.&#xA;Did you not know that these things must&#xA;follow? Should not a king understand who&#xA;gives him good advice and who bad?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana did not like all this lecturing.&#xA;He had no use now for lessons in ethics or&#xA;politics. His face flushed with anger but&#xA;he controlled himself and said: &amp;ldquo;Brother!&#xA;The time is now past for such talk. What I&#xA;need now is not your criticism but your&#xA;prowess. What is done has been done and&#xA;it is useless discussing whether it was just&#xA;or unjust, wise or unwise. The question&#xA;now is what we should do in our present&#xA;predicament. It is your duty now to use&#xA;your strength and skill and ward off the&#xA;present disasters resulting from past&#xA;errors. He is a true friend and a true&#xA;kinsman who helps one out of the trouble&#xA;that has been brought on oneself, maybe&#xA;because of folly. If indeed you care for&#xA;me, the time is now to show it by helping&#xA;me instead of commenting on my conduct.&#xA;I depend on your strength and prowess.&#xA;Out of your infinite courage, give me&#xA;comfort.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kumbhakarna was moved by this&#xA;appeal. &amp;ldquo;Have no more care,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;am your brother and can never forsake&#xA;you. Rest assured that Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana are dead. I shall scatter and&#xA;slay their monkey army. I shall fling at&#xA;your feet the head of Rama and you shall&#xA;see the Vanara King&amp;rsquo;s blood flowing on&#xA;the battlefield. Rama can only approach&#xA;you, if he does, over my dead body and&#xA;that is not possible, for no one can&#xA;vanquish or slay me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Kumbhakarna&amp;rsquo;s pride swelled. &amp;ldquo;No&#xA;matter who the enemy is,&amp;rdquo; be cried, &amp;ldquo;I&#xA;shall destroy him. Be he Yama or Surya or&#xA;Agni, I shall eat them all up.&amp;rdquo; In this&#xA;mood he rushed out to the field of battle.&#xA;The sudden waking from deep slumber&#xA;had completely upset his temper, but&#xA;when his consuming hunger and thirst had&#xA;been appeased, he had recovered his&#xA;balance and spoke wisdom to Ravana.&#xA;Again seeing Ravana&amp;rsquo;s plight, fraternal&#xA;affection and pity made him forget&#xA;everything else.&#xA;Ravana was pleased. &amp;ldquo;O my true&#xA;warrior! O my brother! What a friend in&#xA;need I have in Kumbhakarna!&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;exclaimed, confident that Kumbhakarna&#xA;would return triumphant and he now felt&#xA;like one recovering from a mortal&#xA;sickness.&#xA;Kumbhakarna armed with his great&#xA;spear was about to go to battle alone, but&#xA;Ravana stopped him and sent an army to&#xA;aid him. He covered his brother&amp;rsquo;s big body&#xA;with jewels and garments and blessed him&#xA;saving: &amp;ldquo;Go, my hero! Destroy the&#xA;enemies and return victorious.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Tall and mighty-limbed Kumbhakarna,&#xA;covered with shining jewels, was radiant&#xA;like&#xA;Trivikrama&#xA;himself.&#xA;He&#xA;circumambulated his brother, bowed and&#xA;marched out spear in hand at the head of a&#xA;great army, amidst the plaudits of the&#xA;Rakshasas, and under a shower of flowers&#xA;and good wishes.&#xA;As the huge form of Kumbhakarna, a&#xA;giant even among the Rakshasas, was seen&#xA;stepping across the fortress-wall like&#xA;Yama at the end of Time or some great&#xA;natural cataclysm, the Vanaras were&#xA;frightened and started fleeing in all&#xA;directions. With great difficulty theirchiefs rallied them and put them in battle&#xA;formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RALLIED by Angada, the Vanaras&#xA;recovered courage, reformed in battle&#xA;order&#xA;and&#xA;prepared&#xA;to&#xA;receive&#xA;Kumbhakarna. They hurled rocks at him&#xA;and dealt heavy blows with trees plucked&#xA;by the roots. But he disregarded them all&#xA;and with a smile on his face went on&#xA;dispatching the Vanaras with a methodic&#xA;cruelty that was most terrifying. Some of&#xA;them retreated to the newly built dam,&#xA;while others tried to save themselves by&#xA;concealing on the shore of the sea and the&#xA;forests.&#xA;Once again Angada had to encourage&#xA;the Vanara chiefs and warriors and get&#xA;them to reform and attack Kumbhakarna.&#xA;Dwivida, Hanuman, Nila, Vrishabha,&#xA;Sarabha and other chiefs attacked&#xA;Kumbhakarna fiercely. But he disregarded&#xA;them all and continued his ruthless&#xA;slaughter of the Vanaras. Angada himself&#xA;received a blow, as a result of which he&#xA;fainted and fell on the earth. Sugriva was&#xA;struck down. Picking up the unconscious&#xA;Vanara King, Kumbhakarna carried him&#xA;with joy towards Lanka. The Rakshasa&#xA;army rejoiced greatly and raised a&#xA;triumphant uproar. Kumbhakarna wished&#xA;to make a present of the captive Vanara&#xA;King to his brother Ravana.&#xA;As Kumbhakarna went through the&#xA;royal highway carrying in triumph the&#xA;unconscious Vanara king, the Rakshasas&#xA;and their women-folk, standing on the&#xA;terraces, showered flowers and poured&#xA;sandal paste. This incidentally revived&#xA;Sugriva. He opened his eyes and&#xA;wondered where he was and what had&#xA;happened.&#xA;He&#xA;soon&#xA;understood&#xA;everything.&#xA;He then began to bite with his teeth and&#xA;tear with his nails the ears and nose of the&#xA;Rakshasa who was carrying him. Worried&#xA;thus Kumbhakarna threw him down&#xA;intending to crush him with his feet. But&#xA;when he was once on the ground, Sugriva&#xA;jumped and flew off across the sky and&#xA;arrived at the place where Rama was.&#xA;Hanuman was sure that Sugriva would&#xA;somehow come back. Foreseeing this&#xA;escape of Sugriva, Hanuman had rallied&#xA;the Vanara ranks and prepared them again&#xA;for battle.&#xA;Grim and gruesome with torn nose and&#xA;ears, Kumbhakarna, like a great blood-red&#xA;evening cloud, and raging like Death at&#xA;the end of Time, returned to the battlefield&#xA;with a huge iron mace in his hand.&#xA;None could now stop Kumbhakarna.&#xA;He began to kill and devour the Vanaras.&#xA;The whole army began to disappear in this&#xA;way. They tried to deter him by climbing&#xA;on his mountain-like body and tearing at it&#xA;with nails and teeth but without effect for&#xA;he shook them off as if they were flies.&#xA;None of the Vanara chiefs could hold him.&#xA;Lakshmana tried with his arrows to&#xA;obstruct his progress but the Rakshasa&#xA;passed him by and rushed forward to face&#xA;Rama himself.&#xA;For a long time Rama kept aiming&#xA;powerful darts at the Rakshasa. The arrow&#xA;that pierced the seven sal trees and the&#xA;adamantine body of Vali was powerless&#xA;against Kumbhakarna.&#xA;Sending sharper and stronger arrows,&#xA;Rama wounded the arms and the feet of&#xA;the Rakshasa, but nothing short of death&#xA;would stop him. His legs were cut off, but&#xA;legless he moved about on his stumps and&#xA;went on with demoniac ferocity, fighting&#xA;his brother&amp;rsquo;s battle.&#xA;At last, Rama cut off his head with an&#xA;arrow.&#xA;The severed head, carried by the force&#xA;of Rama&amp;rsquo;s arrow, rose into the sky and red&#xA;with blood fell in Lanka like a hill with itsforests aflame. The news was carried to&#xA;Ravana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Your brother Kumbhakarna, terrible&#xA;like all-destroying Death at the end of&#xA;Time, has entered the heaven of&#xA;slaughtered heroes! He killed thousands of&#xA;Vanaras and for a long time kept the army&#xA;of Rama and Lakshmana in fear of&#xA;destruction. But at last he was, slain by&#xA;Rama himself, and deprived of arms and&#xA;legs his mutilated body lies like a mighty&#xA;tree disfigured by a forest fire. A part has&#xA;fallen into the sea. Another big part blocks&#xA;the entrance to the fortress. The severed&#xA;head, flying across the sky, has dropped in&#xA;the city and is lying there. Your beloved&#xA;brother is gone to Heaven!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the Rakshasas told this tale,&#xA;Ravana felt that his own life had left him.&#xA;He&#xA;swooned.&#xA;After&#xA;recovering&#xA;consciousness, he cried in grief and anger:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ah mighty warrior! How could you go to&#xA;Yama&amp;rsquo;s world leaving me behind? My&#xA;right hand is cut off! How did Rama kill&#xA;you, you whom in the whole world no&#xA;enemy dared approach? I see the gods&#xA;rejoicing in their heavens at your fall. The&#xA;Vanara are dancing with delight. Of what&#xA;use is this kingdom to me? Why should I&#xA;cling to life when my dear brother has left&#xA;me? Yes, I have to torture and slay the&#xA;man who killed this dear brother of mine!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then with sudden and futile remorse he&#xA;wailed: &amp;ldquo;Alas! Why did I refuse to listen&#xA;to Vibhishana?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Trisiras and his other sons tried to&#xA;console Ravana.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is the use of lamentation&amp;rdquo; they&#xA;argued. &amp;ldquo;You who have secured from&#xA;Brahma strength and armor, why should&#xA;you fear or lose yourself in grief?&amp;rdquo; And&#xA;Trisiras himself set out for the battlefield.&#xA;Many others eagerly followed him, riding&#xA;on elephants and chariots.&#xA;A great battle ensued. Narantaka,&#xA;riding on horseback spear in hand,&#xA;wrought havoc among the Vanaras and&#xA;was proceeding towards Sugriva. Angada&#xA;opposed him and killed him and his horse.&#xA;Likewise, Devantaka and Trisiras were&#xA;slain by Hanuman, and Mahodara by Nila.&#xA;Atikaya fell a prey to Lakshmana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;arrows. But before they died, these four&#xA;had fought like four Yamas and caused&#xA;enormous loss to the Vanara forces.&#xA;When Ravana heard that Atikaya was&#xA;dead, he was be wildered.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;This is incredible! These my warriors,&#xA;firm and mighty like mountains and&#xA;irresistible like the ocean, have been slain&#xA;one by one by these enemies. Those, who&#xA;till now have never known defeat, have&#xA;been defeated and lie dead in the&#xA;battlefield. There stand my foes who have&#xA;broken out of the serpent entanglements&#xA;with which my peerless son Indrajit had&#xA;bound them. I cannot explain the marvel&#xA;of this man Rama&amp;rsquo;s strength. May it be&#xA;that he is Narayana himself?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Thus bewildered, Ravana lost heart. He&#xA;wanted that the enemy forces should not&#xA;enter the fortress and in particular should&#xA;not enter the Asoka Vana. He supervised&#xA;the defences again and returned to the&#xA;palace, downcast and forlorn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDRAJIT comforted his father. &amp;ldquo;Why&#xA;should you worry when I am here alive?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;he said and gathered an army, and with it&#xA;made another sortie.&#xA;He swooped down on the Vanara&#xA;forces and killed and wounded thousands&#xA;of them. They were helpless against his&#xA;fury. The Brahmastra of Indrajit was&#xA;effective against even Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana who were tied up by it. They&#xA;lay unconscious on the ground and the&#xA;Rakshasa prince went straight to his&#xA;anxious father with the glad news of this&#xA;achievement.Vibhishana rallied the Vanara leaders&#xA;who had scattered in all directions and put&#xA;hope and courage into them.&#xA;Jambavan, who was more dead than&#xA;alive, moved slowly among the Vanaras,&#xA;inquiring: &amp;ldquo;Is Hanuman alive?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I am here,&amp;rdquo; said Hanuman, and&#xA;bowed low before Jambavan.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My son,&amp;rdquo; said the old Vanara,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;proceed northwards at once across the&#xA;sea to the Himalaya range. Between the&#xA;Rishabha and Kailasa peaks, there is the&#xA;Hill of Herbs. In that hilltop are four&#xA;medicinal plants. If you bring them here&#xA;quickly, Rama and Lakshmana and the&#xA;Vanara army will recover consciousness.&#xA;Their wounds will be healed and they will&#xA;fight again. Do this without loss of time.&#xA;Only you can do this.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accordingly, Hanuman sprang up into&#xA;the air and moved fast. He reached the hill&#xA;described by the venerable Jambavan and&#xA;as he could not identify the plants, he&#xA;carried the whole hill and returned with it&#xA;to Lanka.&#xA;Even with the approach of the Sanjivi&#xA;hill, Rama and Lakshmana and the&#xA;Vanaras felt the darts slip off their bodies.&#xA;Their wounds healed and they became&#xA;strong and stood up.&#xA;The battle was resumed. Taking&#xA;counsel with Rama, Sugriva now chose a&#xA;few Vanaras and ordered them to enter&#xA;Lanka and set fire to the city.&#xA;Towards midnight they entered the city&#xA;with torches. They attacked and&#xA;overpowered the sentry and set fire to the&#xA;palaces and turrets of Lanka. Houses in&#xA;their thousands were reduced to ashes.&#xA;The proud city was reduced to a mass of&#xA;ruin.&#xA;Valmiki describes this incident in&#xA;detail. It reads very much like the&#xA;destruction of cities in modern battles&#xA;with which we are now familiar.&#xA;Seeing Lanka being burnt down by the&#xA;Vanaras, Ravana was furious and sent to&#xA;the battlefield Kumbha and Nikumbha,&#xA;the sons of Kumbhakarna, together with&#xA;Yupaksha and other Rakshasa warriors.&#xA;After another terrible battle, Kumbha&#xA;was slain by Sugriva and Nikumbha by&#xA;Hanuman. Makaraksha, son of Khara,&#xA;who opposed Rama, fell to his fiery&#xA;arrows. Many more mighty Rakshasas&#xA;perished. Then, at the bidding of Ravana,&#xA;Indrajit went once again to the battle.&#xA;He rose into the sky and became in&#xA;visible. Thus he fought again unseen by&#xA;the Vanaras. Indrajit, by his necromancy,&#xA;created a maya-Sita and, putting her in a&#xA;chariot, took her before the Vanara army&#xA;and seemingly killed her in their presence.&#xA;Deceived and horrified by this, the&#xA;Vanaras asked themselves: &amp;ldquo;What good is&#xA;it now to continue this war?&amp;rdquo; They left the&#xA;field and went to Rama with the heart-&#xA;rending news.&#xA;As a result of this trick, Indrajit gained&#xA;time to perform an asuric sacrifice. Rama&#xA;and Lakshmana, like the Vanara warriors,&#xA;believed that Sita was dead and were lost&#xA;in grief. They were completely bewildered&#xA;and helpless when Vibhishana came and&#xA;inquired what had happened.&#xA;He listened to their story. Then he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have been deceived. Never&#xA;would Ravana allow Sita to be killed. This&#xA;is only a trick of sorcery. Indrajit tries to&#xA;defeat you through magic. Having given&#xA;up all hope of achieving success by&#xA;normal means, he has gone to perform an&#xA;asuric sacrifice of great power. If he&#xA;completes it, we cannot vanquish him. We&#xA;should therefore go and obstruct the&#xA;sacrifice. Let Lakshmana go at once and&#xA;mar Indrajit&amp;rsquo;s purpose.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Accepting this advice, Rama sent&#xA;Lakshmana who was ac companied by&#xA;Hanuman and other Vanaras, besides&#xA;Vibhishana. They went to the spot whereIndrajit was about to offer oblations to&#xA;evil spirits. The sacrifice was interrupted&#xA;and a long and fierce battle ensued.&#xA;Ascending his chariot, the son of Ravana&#xA;sent forth his arrows.&#xA;Standing on Hanuman, Lakshmana did&#xA;the same. As they were well matched in&#xA;strength and skill, the battle lasted long.&#xA;The chariot of Indrajit was destroyed in&#xA;the course of the combat and both the&#xA;heroes stood on the ground and continued&#xA;the battle.&#xA;At last, Lakshmana used the Indra-astra&#xA;spell and uttering the name of Rama&#xA;discharged the fatal arrow. The head of&#xA;Indrajit was severed and fell to the ground&#xA;and as it fell, it shone like fire. The Devas&#xA;and Gandharvas showered flowers from&#xA;the heavens.&#xA;Lakshmana then went to Rama. He was&#xA;wounded all over and bleeding. He&#xA;walked slowly, supported by Jambavan&#xA;and Hanuman. Rama had already heard&#xA;the news of the death of Indrajit.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Lakshmana!&amp;rdquo; he cried, &amp;ldquo;this is the end&#xA;of the Rakshasa race. You have achieved&#xA;it.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lakshmana modestly stood back but&#xA;Rama seated him on his lap, kissed his&#xA;head and gave vent to his joy.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You have performed a mighty deed,&#xA;impossible for anyone else. You have&#xA;deprived Ravana of his right hand. Who in&#xA;the world can equal you or Vibhishana or&#xA;Hanuman? I have no more care. You have&#xA;vanquished the conqueror of Indra. I feel I&#xA;have already recovered Sita.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The news reached Ravana that Indrajit&#xA;had been slain by Lakshmana. When he&#xA;heard that Vibhishana helped Lakshmana&#xA;in slaying Indrajit, his grief and anger&#xA;swelled and the tears he shed burnt where&#xA;they fell. And from his mouth issued fire.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Alas, my son! O peerless warrior! O&#xA;hero! Vanquisher of the great Indra! Has&#xA;Death won after all? Have you entered the&#xA;heaven of heroes? But I should not&#xA;grieve,&amp;rdquo; he said.&#xA;But the father&amp;rsquo;s heart would not thus be&#xA;denied, and again he cried: &amp;ldquo;What! Is&#xA;Indrajit gone? The world is now empty for&#xA;me. Oh son, you have left your mother&#xA;Mandodari and your dear wife and myself&#xA;heart-broken and disconsolate. Nothing&#xA;remains to us now but revenge and&#xA;despair. It is best to kill Sita, the cause of&#xA;all this tragedy. My son killed the maya-&#xA;Sita. Now I shall kill the real Sita her&#xA;self.&amp;rdquo; So saying he rushed out, sword in&#xA;hand, intending to do it. Some fierce&#xA;Rakshasas, seeing Ravana issuing out in&#xA;anger, applauded him with joy; but the&#xA;minister Suparsva was horrified and&#xA;appealed to Ravana&amp;rsquo;s better sense and&#xA;what was due to himself as a man and a&#xA;king.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;King!&amp;rdquo; he cried, &amp;ldquo;how dare you think&#xA;such a thought? How can you do it? Oh,&#xA;Lord of ten heads! Brother of Kubera! Are&#xA;you thinking to kill a woman? Are you&#xA;going to incur this shame and sin? Can&#xA;you thus be tempted by anger? You have&#xA;mastered the Vedas and all the sciences.&#xA;You have performed many penances.&#xA;How can you end up with such a thing as&#xA;this? Who is equal to you? Let us direct&#xA;our anger against Rama. It will be new&#xA;moon tomorrow. Gather all your armies,&#xA;issue out of Lanka, slay Rama and&#xA;Lakshmana and achieve victory. Then&#xA;take Sita. Put on the armor you have&#xA;secured from Brahma. Ascend your&#xA;chariot and go to battle.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Ravana felt that Suparsva was right and&#xA;his words were good. Seated on his&#xA;throne, he was silent for a while, lost in&#xA;profound meditation. Then he addressed&#xA;the commanders with folded hands,&#xA;saying:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Go now with all your strength and&#xA;slay Rama. If even you fail, I shall go&#xA;myself and destroy him.&amp;ldquo;Never before had he been so courteous&#xA;and humble when dealing with his&#xA;officers. Adversity had taught him this&#xA;lesson. Mounted on chariots that shone&#xA;like the hills on the evening horizon and&#xA;on the back of great elephants and&#xA;beautiful horses, Ravana&amp;rsquo;s army went in&#xA;full force for the great battle.&#xA;The Vanaras tore up rocks and trees&#xA;and attacked the Rakshasas fiercely. The&#xA;Rakshasas returned the attack with equally&#xA;grim ferocity.&#xA;The Vanaras jumped about everywhere&#xA;and worked havoc among the Rakshasas,&#xA;their chariots and animals. Each of the&#xA;Rakshasas was surrounded by many&#xA;Vanaras and slain.&#xA;The Rakshasas too did not spare the&#xA;Vanaras whom they killed in tens of&#xA;thousands.&#xA;Rama bent his bow and sent showers of&#xA;arrows against the Rakshasas who&#xA;destroyed their army like a raging fire.&#xA;Warriors only saw their companions fall.&#xA;They could not see Rama because of the&#xA;shower of arrows. Their fear conjured up&#xA;a multitude of Ramas, who dealt death in&#xA;all directions.&#xA;Countless&#xA;elephants&#xA;and&#xA;horses&#xA;perished. Thousands of chariots were&#xA;broken. The Rakshasa army was&#xA;destroyed, all but a handful who fled into&#xA;Lanka.&#xA;The Devas, Gandharvas and Siddhas&#xA;sang the praise of Rama from above. In&#xA;Lanka, the Rakshasa women clung to each&#xA;other and lamented loudly that Ravana&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;folly should have brought this great&#xA;calamity on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THERE was wailing in every house in&#xA;Lanka. In Ravana&amp;rsquo;s breast grief, shame&#xA;and anger seethed like a raging sea. He&#xA;had so far sent his commanders and men&#xA;in detachments, and, brave as they were,&#xA;they had been destroyed in detail. This&#xA;had been the result of overweening&#xA;confidence in his invincibility and&#xA;contempt for the enemy, most of whom&#xA;fought with no better weapons than sticks&#xA;and stones. But repeated reverses had&#xA;brought him no wisdom.&#xA;He had not even disputed the passage&#xA;of the sea but allowed the enemy a&#xA;lodgment in his island. But negligent and&#xA;reckless as a general, he was brave and&#xA;finally resolving to fight himself and with&#xA;his sole strength to destroy the foe, he set&#xA;out. He had full faith in his prowess and in&#xA;the efficacy of the boons he had secured&#xA;and he went forth with confidence&#xA;mounted on his divine chariot that was&#xA;drawn by eight horses and filled with all&#xA;manner of weapons accompanied by a&#xA;division of Rakshasa chariot-warriors.&#xA;As Ravana issued out of Lanka, the sun&#xA;seemed obscured by an unpredicted&#xA;eclipse, and foul birds and beasts of the&#xA;night roared at large with weird ill-&#xA;omened cries; but disregarding it all,&#xA;Ravana drove out to battle accompanied&#xA;by&#xA;Virupaksha,&#xA;Mahodara&#xA;and&#xA;Mahaparsva.&#xA;The mighty Rakshasa warriors who&#xA;followed Ravana were mowed down by a&#xA;deadly flight of arrows and chunks of&#xA;rocks and presently Ravana found himself&#xA;facing Lakshmana, who tried to oppose&#xA;his further progress. Forcing his way past&#xA;Lakshmana, Ravana precipitated himself&#xA;against Rama with all the pent-up fury of&#xA;hatred and revenge and strove to&#xA;overwhelm him with a spate of arrows.&#xA;Rama easily baffled these arrows with&#xA;his own and struck Ravana repeatedly,&#xA;without however being able to penetrate&#xA;his armor. Thus they fought, these&#xA;supreme bowmen, each bent on slaying&#xA;the other and using increasingly potent&#xA;missiles of secret power, while the gods in&#xA;heaven looked on with marvel and&#xA;admiration. Neither hero had met such anopponent before and on both sides&#xA;admiration was mingled with wrath.&#xA;Rama pierced with his darts every limb&#xA;of Ravana. And yet he did not fall.&#xA;Then Lakshmana and Vibhishana&#xA;together attacked Ravana. Furious with&#xA;his brother and determined to kill him,&#xA;Ravana flung at him a powerful weapon.&#xA;But intercepted by a dart of Lakshmana it&#xA;broke into two and fell on the ground like&#xA;a burning brand. Once again, Ravana&#xA;aimed another mighty sakti against&#xA;Vibhishana.&#xA;This&#xA;too&#xA;Lakshmana&#xA;intercepted. Then Ravana hurled a sakti at&#xA;Lakshmana crying: &amp;ldquo;Now you are dead!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Under its impact Lakshmana fell down&#xA;unconscious on the ground.&#xA;Not observing this, Rama went on&#xA;keeping up his pressure against Ravana.&#xA;While the battle raged between the two,&#xA;the Vanara leaders took counsel and sent&#xA;Hanuman once again to the Hill of Herbs&#xA;to save the life of Lakshmana.&#xA;For the second time, Hanuman flew&#xA;northwards and, not wasting time&#xA;searching for the plants, returned with the&#xA;whole mountain. Lakshmana got well&#xA;again and resumed his part in the battle.&#xA;Meanwhile, Matali brought his master&#xA;Indra&amp;rsquo;s chariot to the battlefield for the use&#xA;of Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Indra, king of gods, has sent this for&#xA;your use,&amp;rdquo; said Matali. &amp;ldquo;Be pleased to&#xA;ascend this chariot and destroy Ravana,&#xA;the enemy of the gods!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama&#xA;bowed&#xA;to&#xA;the&#xA;gods,&#xA;circumambulated the divine chariot and&#xA;ascended it. Then followed a wonderful&#xA;battle.&#xA;Sorely&#xA;wounded,&#xA;Ravana&#xA;fell&#xA;unconscious&#xA;and,&#xA;noting&#xA;this,&#xA;his&#xA;charioteer quietly took him out of the&#xA;battlefield.&#xA;When, a little later, Ravana recovered&#xA;consciousness, he was highly wroth, with&#xA;his charioteer for taking him out of the&#xA;battlefield and insisted on being taken&#xA;back to face Rama. The grim battle began&#xA;again. Every astra was met by another. In&#xA;new and wonderful ways, the two chariots&#xA;moved and the two warriors fought for a&#xA;long time, while both armies watched the&#xA;spectacle with breathless admiration and&#xA;anxiety.&#xA;Matali, the charioteer, whispered into&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s ear: &amp;ldquo;The Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s end is&#xA;approaching. Delay no further. May I&#xA;remind you of Brahma-astra?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama uttered the spell and sent the&#xA;Brahma-astra. Though the Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s ten&#xA;heads had often been cut off before, they&#xA;had grown again and baffled Rama. The&#xA;Brahma-astra, emitting flames, went&#xA;towards Ravana and pierced his chest,&#xA;where was enshrined the secret of his&#xA;invincibility, and shattered it.&#xA;Then the bow slipped from the&#xA;Rakshasa&amp;rsquo;s hand and he fell down from&#xA;the chariot and lay stretched on the&#xA;battlefield.&#xA;The gods blew their trumpets. Rama&#xA;and his chariot were covered by a heap of&#xA;flowers showered from the heavens.&#xA;Lakshmana, Vibhishana, Jambavan and&#xA;other warriors surrounded Rama, lost in&#xA;joy and adoration.&#xA;When the first flush of triumph was&#xA;over and Vibhishana looked at his&#xA;brother&amp;rsquo;s body, the natural call of blood&#xA;and memories of boyhood days when&#xA;Ravana and he had loved and played quite&#xA;overwhelmed him and he burst into&#xA;lamentations over his lost brother.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;O warrior!&amp;rdquo; he cried. &amp;ldquo;O brother of&#xA;heroic deeds! O scholar learned in all&#xA;Shastras! O valiant and famous King of&#xA;kings! Your great arms are, now&#xA;sprawling helpless on the ground! Self-&#xA;willed and self-deceived, surrounded by&#xA;bad advisers, you would not heed my&#xA;warning! The worst I feared has happened&#xA;now! You reaped what you sowed andyou lie on the bare ground, O once mighty&#xA;ruler of the Rakshasas!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;To Vibhishana thus lamenting, Rama&#xA;spoke:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ravana fought like a true warrior and&#xA;fell fighting like a hero! Death has washed&#xA;his sins. It calls for no mourning. Ravana&#xA;has entered Heaven.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama cleared all confusion from&#xA;Vibhishana&amp;rsquo;s mind and bade him do the&#xA;funeral rites for his departed brother.&#xA;Said Rama: &amp;ldquo;It is for you now, his&#xA;brother, to do the rites. Death ends all&#xA;enmity. I, his former foe, even I can&#xA;rightly perform his obsequies. Your&#xA;brother is my brother too, is he not?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The women of Ravana&amp;rsquo;s palace came to&#xA;the field to mourn. They led the Queen&#xA;Mandodari, who looked like the goddess&#xA;of grief incarnate. The crowned queen and&#xA;beloved wife of Ravana was in utter&#xA;desolation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Indra, King of gods, dared not face&#xA;your anger,&amp;rdquo; she cried. &amp;ldquo;The Rishis and&#xA;the Gandharvas at the very sight of you&#xA;fled in fear in all directions. And now a&#xA;mere man, a wanderer in the forest, has&#xA;brought you down! I do not understand&#xA;how this could have happened. Truly, Fate&#xA;is all-powerful! But lord, my lord, I&#xA;warned you long ago. Did I not tell you&#xA;that this Rama is no mere human being,&#xA;but someone greater than Indra or Agni or&#xA;Yama, whom you could not vanquish?&#xA;This Rama is no other than Vishnu&#xA;Himself in human form, God without&#xA;beginning, middle or end. Even when we&#xA;heard that he stood on the ground riding&#xA;no car and slew your brother Khara in&#xA;Janasthana, did I not say this? When&#xA;Hanuman&#xA;penetrated&#xA;Lank&#xA;the&#xA;impenetrable fortress, and laid it waste, I&#xA;knew the truth. I begged you not to incur&#xA;their enmity but you would not listen.&#xA;Why did you cast lustful eyes on chaste&#xA;Sita? This was the madness that drove you&#xA;to your death! Was it not a heinous sin to&#xA;carry her off when she was alone? Death&#xA;in the form of Sita drew you to your end!&#xA;Sita and Rama are now reunited and&#xA;happy after their brief separation. But me&#xA;and all our race you have thrust for very&#xA;into the depths of sorrow. Alas, my&#xA;husband, my lover. You lie dead. Yet how&#xA;beautiful you look with your body pierced&#xA;by Rama&amp;rsquo;s darts, covered with blood and&#xA;dust of battle! What should I do now? I&#xA;had a lord who was the Lord of Lanka! I&#xA;had a son who had vanquished Indra.&#xA;They have left me and I am a mere&#xA;helpless widow without friends or home!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Lamenting thus, Mandodari fell on&#xA;Ravana&amp;rsquo;s body and lay unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VIBHISHANA was crowned King of&#xA;Lanka in a magnificent ceremony. The&#xA;new Lord of Lanka came out to the&#xA;Vanara camp and bowed low before&#xA;Rama.&#xA;Then Rama said to Hanuman: &amp;ldquo;With&#xA;the King&amp;rsquo;s permission, enter Lanka and&#xA;tell Sita what has happened.&amp;rdquo; Hanuman&#xA;accordingly&#xA;took&#xA;permission&#xA;from&#xA;Vibhishana and went to Asoka Vana to&#xA;convey the news to Sita.&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s joy was beyond words. She was&#xA;silent.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Why, mother,&amp;rdquo; asked Hanuman, &amp;ldquo;why&#xA;do you not speak?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is there to say, my son?&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;answered. &amp;ldquo;How can I repay my debt to&#xA;you? Your wisdom, your valor, your&#xA;prowess, your patience, your humility are&#xA;all your own. None in the world can equal&#xA;you.&amp;rdquo; As she said this, her eyes filled with&#xA;tears of gratitude and affection.&#xA;Hanuman looked at the Rakshasi&#xA;women who had guarded Sita and turning&#xA;to Sita said: &amp;ldquo;I wish to slay these cruel&#xA;women who troubled you. Do give me&#xA;leave!&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;No, my son,&amp;rdquo; she answered. &amp;ldquo;Who in&#xA;the world is blameless? It is the part of&#xA;noble souls to be compassionate towards&#xA;all sinners as well as good people.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;These words of Sita are treasured like&#xA;nectar by generations of pious men. The&#xA;worst of sinners, clinging to the golden&#xA;feet of the Mother, can gain forgiveness.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;These Rakshasis,&amp;rdquo; she continued &amp;ldquo;but&#xA;carried out their master&amp;rsquo;s orders. How are&#xA;they to blame? Their king is dead and has&#xA;paid for his crime. It is unjust to punish&#xA;these Rakshasis now.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;All that Hanuman could find to say in&#xA;reverent admiration was that what she said&#xA;was only what was worthy of Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;wife.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What message am I to carry to&#xA;Rama?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I am eager to be in his presence,&amp;rdquo; she&#xA;answered. &amp;ldquo;That is all.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Hanuman returned to Rama and gave&#xA;an account of his visit. For some reason&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s face now darkened and with lack-&#xA;lustre eyes he fell into a frown study. A&#xA;little later he turned to Vibhishana and&#xA;said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ask Sita to bathe and bedeck herself&#xA;and bring her here.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;When the message reached Sita in the&#xA;Asoka Vana, she said: &amp;ldquo;I would rather go&#xA;as I am.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Not so, my lady,&amp;rdquo; said Vibhishana,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;the prince&amp;rsquo;s orders should be obeyed.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;So, after a bath and bedecked with&#xA;jewels and seated in a palanquin, Sita&#xA;went to the camp.&#xA;When he heard that Sita was coming,&#xA;Rama woke up from his meditation.&#xA;Events of the past rose like waves and&#xA;battering against his mind threw it into a&#xA;wild commotion of shame, grief and joy.&#xA;As Sita&amp;rsquo;s palanquin was taken through&#xA;the great concourse of Vanaras, they&#xA;thronged round the princess and caused&#xA;confusion. It was made worse by the&#xA;Vanara leaders trying to push them aside&#xA;and make way for the palanquin.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Let no one be kept away,&amp;rdquo; said Rama.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;These dear Vanaras have stood and&#xA;suffered for me. Sita will be pleased to see&#xA;me surrounded by such friends. Let no&#xA;one be pushed away.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s face showed a strange&#xA;transformation of mind. None of those&#xA;around him, not even Lakshmana could&#xA;understand.&#xA;Alighting from the palanquin, Sita,&#xA;with downcast eyes, proceeded towards&#xA;Rama. &amp;ldquo;Aryaputra,&amp;rdquo; she said and sobbed,&#xA;unable to speak more.&#xA;Aryaputra in Sanskrit means beloved&#xA;and noble one and is an intimate form of&#xA;address of wife to husband.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I have slain the enemy,&amp;rdquo; said Rama. I&#xA;have recovered you. I have done my duty&#xA;as a Kshatriya. My vow is now fulfilled.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Incomprehensible&#xA;and&#xA;wholly&#xA;unexpected were these words that he&#xA;uttered. His face darkened for some&#xA;reason. Then he spoke even harsher&#xA;words.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It was not for mere attachment to you&#xA;that I waged this grim battle but in the&#xA;discharge of duty as a Kshatriya. It gives&#xA;me no joy now to get you back, for&#xA;doubtfulness envelopes you like a dark&#xA;cloud of smoke.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What do you wish to do now?&amp;rdquo; he&#xA;continued. &amp;ldquo;You must live alone, for we&#xA;cannot live together. You can stay under&#xA;the protection of any of our kinsmen or&#xA;friends. How can a Kshatriya take back a&#xA;wife who has lived so long in a stranger&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;house?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Sita looked at Rama. Her eyes flashed&#xA;fire.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Unworthy words have you spoken!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;she said. &amp;ldquo;My ears have heard them and&#xA;my heart is broken. The uncultured may&#xA;speak such words but not one nobly born&#xA;and brought up like you. Your anger, itseems, has destroyed your understanding.&#xA;My lord does not remember the family&#xA;from which I come. Janaka, the great seer,&#xA;was my father and he brought me up. Is it&#xA;my fault that the wicked Rakshasa seized&#xA;me by force and imprisoned me? But&#xA;since this is how you look at it, there is&#xA;but one course open to me.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Then turning to Lakshmana, &amp;ldquo;Fetch the&#xA;faggots, Lakshmana, and kindle a fire,&amp;rdquo;&#xA;she said.&#xA;Lakshmana, who had been watching&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;behavior&#xA;in&#xA;dismay&#xA;and&#xA;indignation turned to look at Rama&amp;rsquo;s face&#xA;seeking his orders, but Rama did not say&#xA;&amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; to Sita&amp;rsquo;s request nor show any sign of&#xA;softening. Obeying Sita, Lakshmana&#xA;kindled a big fire and the princess, with&#xA;eyes&#xA;fixed&#xA;on&#xA;the&#xA;ground,&#xA;circumambulated her lord and exclaimed:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Ye Gods, I bow before you. Oh rishis,&#xA;I bow to you. Oh Agni, you at least know&#xA;my purity and will take me as your own!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;With these words she jumped into the&#xA;flames. And wonder of wonders! The&#xA;lambent flames were crowded with&#xA;celestial figures, for all the gods came and&#xA;assembled&#xA;there.&#xA;Brahma&#xA;spoke:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Narayana! Mighty God that took human&#xA;form to slay Ravana! Is not this your own&#xA;Lakshmi?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Agni, God of fire, rose in his own body&#xA;out of the flames and lifting Sita in his&#xA;arms with all her clothes and jewels&#xA;untouched and intact, presented her to&#xA;Rama.&#xA;Rama said to Brahma: &amp;ldquo;Who am I? All&#xA;that I know and can tell is that I am Rama,&#xA;son of Dasaratha. You know who I am&#xA;and whence I came and more. It is you&#xA;who must inform me.&amp;rdquo; Saying this to&#xA;Brahma, Rama accepted Sita fire-proved.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Think you that I did not know your&#xA;irreproachable purity? This ordeal was to&#xA;satisfy the people. Without it, they would&#xA;say that Rama, blinded by love, behaved&#xA;with a strange weakness and broke the&#xA;rule of well-brought-up men.&amp;rdquo; So saying&#xA;he drew her to his side.&#xA;Then Dasaratha descended from above&#xA;and, placing the prince on his lap blessed&#xA;him.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;My child!&amp;rdquo; he said to Sita. &amp;ldquo;Forgive&#xA;my son. Forgive him for the wrong he did&#xA;you to preserve the dharma of the world.&#xA;God bless you!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Indra gave his boon, and the Vanaras&#xA;who died in battle for Rama regained their&#xA;lives.&#xA;Rama and Sita, now reunited, ascended&#xA;the Pushpaka which carried them swiftly&#xA;in the air with their friends, the Vanara&#xA;warriors and Vibhishana, to Ayodhya.&#xA;As they travelled in the sky, he said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Look there! That is the causeway built by&#xA;Nala.&amp;rdquo; Again, &amp;ldquo;Look there, that is&#xA;Kishkindha,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;where I met and&#xA;made friends with Hanuman and Sugriva.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And Rama pointed out to Sita the spots&#xA;where he and Lakshmana had wandered&#xA;disconsolate and related to her all his&#xA;unforgettable experiences.&#xA;Alighting at Bharadwaja&amp;rsquo;s ashrama,&#xA;they sent word in advance to Guha and&#xA;Bharata.&#xA;The city of Ayodhya swam in a sea of&#xA;joy. Rama and Bharata met. Planning for&#xA;Bharata&amp;rsquo;s sake, ambitious Kaikeyi and her&#xA;hunchback maid had contrived and&#xA;concocted plots. But now, as Bharata&#xA;bowed at the feet of Rama, a joy deeper&#xA;than what they had planned for him was&#xA;his. What kingly crown could equal the&#xA;joy one found at Rama&amp;rsquo;s feet? What&#xA;sovereignty could bring one the glory that&#xA;was now Bharata&amp;rsquo;s forever?&#xA;The Vaishnava hymns exalt Bharata&#xA;even above Rama for a spotless mind and&#xA;unblemished unselfishness. For fourteen&#xA;years till the return of Rama, Bharata&#xA;installed&#xA;Rama&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;padukas&#xA;and&#xA;administered the kingdom as a devotionalexercise in the service of his brother. Now&#xA;that Rama was crowned King as his father&#xA;had wished, Bharata&amp;rsquo;s penance was at an&#xA;end and his heart was filled with joy.&#xA;The smile of divine grace brightened&#xA;Sita&amp;rsquo;s face as she cast her merciful glance&#xA;on Hanuman. What more could Hanuman&#xA;desire?&#xA;I have retold in brief compass the story&#xA;of the Prince of Ayodhya as sung by&#xA;Valmiki. Those who read or listen to the&#xA;tale, it is said, will be saved from sin and&#xA;sorrow.&#xA;Sri Sankara, the master of&#xA;wisdom, has said that, if one keeps in&#xA;one&amp;rsquo;s heart the son of Dasaratha and&#xA;meditates on him with reverence, one&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;sins will all be burnt up as chaff in a fire.&#xA;After the avatar of Rama, the lord&#xA;appeared again among men with greater&#xA;soulabhya (easy accessibility) as Govinda.&#xA;He lived among cowherders as one of&#xA;them and served Arjuna as a chariot&#xA;driver. At the end of the Gita, the Lord&#xA;says to Arjuna:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Believe in me as the sole refuge, cast&#xA;aside all doubt and come unto me. I shall&#xA;save you from all sins. This is truth,&#xA;friend. Cast off your fear.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This promise of Sri Krishna is&#xA;addressed to all of us. We, like Arjuna,&#xA;have our doubts and fears in the&#xA;Kurukshetra of life and this assurance of&#xA;grace is for all of us, for we are all dear to&#xA;Him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On one occasion Gandhiji and I were&#xA;talking about a girl very dear to both of&#xA;us. I said: &amp;ldquo;How did she get all these ideas&#xA;and phrases of love without having read&#xA;any of present-day love stories?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Gandhiji said in answer: &amp;ldquo;But has she&#xA;not read the Ramayana? Is the Ramayana&#xA;not a love story too?&amp;rdquo; This struck me as&#xA;profound. Then we turned to other&#xA;matters.&#xA;Dasaratha&amp;rsquo;s troubles began with love.&#xA;Then the love of Rama and Sita is the&#xA;theme and substance of Ayodhya Kanda.&#xA;In love that is not opposed to dharma,&#xA;we find a manifestation of God. So was it&#xA;affirmed by Sri Krishna when he&#xA;explained his manifold being to Arjuna.&#xA;The Ramayana has, for its twin theme,&#xA;love that is opposed to dharma also. The&#xA;Ramayana is undoubtedly a great love&#xA;story.&#xA;Those who regard the Ramayana as an&#xA;allegory interpret Sita as the individual&#xA;soul and Rama as the Supreme Being.&#xA;God seeks and pursues the human soul till&#xA;He secures it. He is eager to save us. It is&#xA;enough if we just do not obstruct or resist.&#xA;There are also other interpretations and&#xA;applications of the Ramayana. Sita, the&#xA;female counterpart of the Supreme Being,&#xA;is the embodiment of compassion and&#xA;grace. Compassion is the Supreme Mother&#xA;and she is enthroned in the heart of the&#xA;Lord. When she casts her merciful glance&#xA;on us, we reach the feet of God.&#xA;Parvati&amp;rsquo;s function in relation to Siva&#xA;and Lakshmi&amp;rsquo;s in relation to Hari are both&#xA;identical, and are just variations of the&#xA;same creed of dependence on God&amp;rsquo;s grace.&#xA;God as Father and God as Mother are not&#xA;distinct. If the Lord were to be parted&#xA;from compassion, our plight would be just&#xA;that of Ravana who separated Sita from&#xA;Rama. The quality of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;compassion can be understood from the&#xA;experience of true human love.&#xA;Many meanings can be read in the&#xA;Ramayana and its beauty appreciated in&#xA;many ways as from a real diamond many&#xA;glorious&#xA;colors&#xA;emanate.&#xA;Seventeen&#xA;months ago I began writing these weekly&#xA;chapters not without fear and trembling.&#xA;This week I close it full of thankfulness&#xA;for the health of body and peace of mind&#xA;that enabled me to complete this humble&#xA;service. Learned men will no doubt findmany faults in what I have written. But&#xA;they must be glad also that it has done&#xA;some good.&#xA;A word to the children who read these&#xA;chapters. I have told the story of the&#xA;Prince of Ayodhya mainly for your sake.&#xA;Grown up people may read Valmiki and&#xA;Kamban. Those who know how to sing&#xA;can render with joy the sweet songs on&#xA;Rama given to us by Tyagaraja. But this&#xA;story that I have told can be read direct by&#xA;you, children, without anyone&amp;rsquo;s help.&#xA;You should look upon Rama,&#xA;Lakshmana and Hanuman like your own&#xA;fathers and elder brothers who are by your&#xA;side ever eager to help you. Grow to be&#xA;like Bharata, Lakshmana and Hanuman,&#xA;good and brave souls, full of love and&#xA;strength.&#xA;Mothers too, I know, have been&#xA;reading this story with joy. This has been&#xA;a great encouragement to me. They can&#xA;understand why I have told the story in&#xA;simple words and short sentences for the&#xA;sake of our children. Everything we do,&#xA;we do for the sake of our children, do we&#xA;not? Only women can realise and relive&#xA;the experiences and feelings of Sita.&#xA;The story of Sita as told by Valmiki&#xA;and Kamban can be fully appreciated only&#xA;by women. Only they can fully appreciate&#xA;the courage of Jatayu and the prowess of&#xA;Hanuman. Sita&amp;rsquo;s sorrows have not ended&#xA;with the Ramayana. They go on, still, in&#xA;the lives of our women.&#xA;In the Rama avatar, Rama did not&#xA;know that he was God incarnate. Krishna&#xA;knew that he was an avatar and acted&#xA;accordingly. We should read the two&#xA;stories with this difference in mind. The&#xA;despair and grief that the man Rama&#xA;experienced, Krishna never knew. When&#xA;he sucked at the demon-woman&amp;rsquo;s breast or&#xA;was bound with a rope and thrashed for&#xA;mischief, he cared not nor grieved.&#xA;Standing weaponless in the battlefield, he&#xA;led the warrior to destroy the wicked. In&#xA;every episode of Krishna we see the&#xA;difference between the two avatars.&#xA;I have followed the story of the Prince&#xA;of Ayodhya as told by Valmiki. There was&#xA;a legend current among people, I think&#xA;even before Valmiki&amp;rsquo;s time, that after&#xA;recovering Sita, for fear of scandal, Rama&#xA;sent her away to live in the forest.&#xA;This pathetic episode must have sprung&#xA;from the sorrow-laden imagination of our&#xA;women. It has taken shape as the Uttara&#xA;Kanda of Ramayana. Although there is&#xA;beauty in the Uttara Kanda, I must say my&#xA;heart rebels against it. Valmiki had&#xA;disposed of this old legend through the&#xA;fire ordeal in the battlefield. Even that&#xA;ordeal does not seem to me as consistent&#xA;with Rama&amp;rsquo;s character. It is painful to read&#xA;it.&#xA;As the prince returned from Mithila he&#xA;met Parasurama. I have heard it said that&#xA;with that meeting Parasurama&amp;rsquo;s avatar&#xA;came to an end. Likewise, it should be&#xA;held, I think, that Rama&amp;rsquo;s avatar came to&#xA;an end with the slaying of Ravana. After&#xA;that battle, Rama remained only as a King&#xA;of the Ikshvaku race.&#xA;On this theory, Rama&amp;rsquo;s treatment of&#xA;Sita after the battle and in the Uttara&#xA;Kanda can be explained simply as the&#xA;behavior of a king in accordance with the&#xA;customs of the times.&#xA;But, how can we comment on a work&#xA;composed thousands of years ago and&#xA;coming down to us in palm-leaf&#xA;manuscripts subject to corruption? If,&#xA;even after the fire-ordeal in the Yuddha&#xA;Kanda, it is said in the Uttara Kanda that&#xA;Sita was sent to the forest, we may take it&#xA;that it mirrors the voiceless and endless&#xA;suffering of our women folk.&#xA;Sorrow and joy are both alike the play&#xA;of God. God himself took with him his&#xA;divine spouse, the embodiment of his own&#xA;supreme compassion, into the world ofmen and women, and enacted with her a&#xA;great drama of joy and sorrow in the&#xA;Ramayana.&#xA;Rain falling from the heaven flows into&#xA;the rivers and flows down to join the sea.&#xA;Again from the sea the water is sucked up&#xA;by the sun and rises to the sky, whence it&#xA;descends again as rain and flows down as&#xA;rivers. Even so, feelings and values rise&#xA;from the people and, touching the poet&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;heart, are transformed into a poem which,&#xA;in turn, enlightens and inspires the people.&#xA;Thus in every land the poets and their&#xA;people continuously reinforce each other.&#xA;The tenderness and purity and the untold&#xA;sufferings of women took shape as the&#xA;Uttara Ramayana. Like an unflickering&#xA;lamp, it throws light on the quality of their&#xA;hearts. Whether the epics and songs of a&#xA;nation spring from the faith and ideas of&#xA;the common folk, or whether a nation&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;faith and ideas are produced by its&#xA;literature is a question which one is free to&#xA;answer as one likes.&#xA;Does a plant spring from the seed or&#xA;does seed issue from the plant? Was the&#xA;bird or the egg the first cause? Did clouds&#xA;rise from the sea or was the sea filled by&#xA;the waters from the sky? All such&#xA;inquiries take us to the feet of God&#xA;transcending speech and thought.&#xA;One other point, in describing how&#xA;Ravana carried off Sita, Kamban differs&#xA;from Valmiki. In Kamban&amp;rsquo;s Ramayana,&#xA;Ravana does not seize and carry Sita as&#xA;Valmiki describes; without touching her&#xA;he lifts her with the earth on which she&#xA;stands. Kamban&amp;rsquo;s version is followed by&#xA;most popular expositors because this&#xA;version is less painful to our feelings.&#xA;It is no sin or shame to an innocent&#xA;woman if a villain behaves like a brute.&#xA;Yet, mistakenly, we in this country look&#xA;on the violence of a brute as causing a&#xA;blemish to the woman&amp;rsquo;s purity. It is in&#xA;deference to this wrong feeling that&#xA;Kamban departed from Valmiki here.&#xA;For the same reason, Tulasidas relates&#xA;that the Sita seized and carried off by&#xA;Ravana was not the real Sita at all but a&#xA;palpable image of hers left behind by the&#xA;real Sita. Thus the story is told in all&#xA;North India. During the fire ordeal, it is&#xA;the maya-Sita that disappears and the real&#xA;Sita springs again and returns from the&#xA;flames.&#xA;It was perhaps presumptuous on my&#xA;part to have begun the task, but it was a&#xA;joy to retell the Ramayana. Now, when it&#xA;is over, I feel like one awaking from a&#xA;dream of joy. When the prince left the&#xA;city, he felt no sorrow. It was only when&#xA;he lost Sita that he knew grief. So with me&#xA;too.&#xA;When I had to step down from high&#xA;office and heavy responsibility, I did not&#xA;feel at a loss or wonder what to do next.&#xA;But now, when I have come to the end of&#xA;the tale of the Prince of Ayodhya, the void&#xA;is like that of a shrine without a God. Let&#xA;no one look upon work as a burden. Good&#xA;work is the secret that keeps life going.&#xA;While one should not hanker after results,&#xA;life without work would be unendurable.Glossary&#xA;Adisesha : The primordial Serpent&#xA;which is Lord Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
