The Death Of Indrajit End Of Ravana The End Epilogue AUTHOR’S PREFACE The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has added to the debt of gratitude owed it by undertaking the publication of the English version of my Tamil Ramayana. They achieved great success in the distribution of my Mahabharata book and I trust this book of the story of Rama and Sita will receive similar welcome. Once again, I repeat my confession that in the evening of my busy life during a great and eventful period of Indian history, the writing of these two books wherein I have retold the Mahabharata and Ramayana, is, in my opinion, the best service I have rendered to my people. At any rate, they embody the best joy I have experienced; for in these two books I helped our great sages to speak to our dear men and women again in their own language, elevating their minds through the sorrows borne by Kunti, Kausalya, Draupadi and Sita. The real need of the hour is a recommunion between us and the sages of our land, so that the future may be built on rock and not on sand. In presenting this English version to a wider circle of readers spread all over the world, I think I am presenting to them the people of Bharat just as they are, with all their virtues and their faults. Our classics really embody our national character in all its aspects and it is well the world sees us as we really are, apart from what we wish to become. The Ramayana is not history or biography. It is a part of Hindu mythology. One cannot understand Hindu dharma unless one knows Rama and Sita, Bharata, Lakshmana, Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Hanuman. Mythology cannot be dispensed with. Philosophy alone or rituals alone or mythology alone cannot be sufficient. These are the three stands of all ancient religions. The attitude towards things spiritual which belongs to a particular people cannot be grasped or preserved or conveyed unless we have all these three. The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has achieved great work by the very wide distribution organised by it of my Ramayana and Mahabharata books, which seek to bring Valmiki and Vyasa near to those who have no access to the unrivalled original classics. The characters and incidents of these two itihasas have come to be the raw material for the works of numerous poets and saints that came later to write dramas and sing poems and hymns to keep this nation in the straight path. Oral discourses have further played with them in order to entertain and instruct pious audiences and not a few variations and additions have been made to the original. All the languages of India have the Ramayana and Mahabharata retold by their poets, with additions and variations of their own. They are the records of the mind and spirit of our forefathers who cared for the good, ever so much more than for the pleasant and who saw more of the mystery of life than we can do in our interminable pursuit for petty and illusory achievements ill the material plane. We should be thankful to those who preserved for us these many centuries-old epics in spite of all the vicissitudes through which our nation passed since Vyasa and Valmiki’s time. Even the poets who wrote these epics in the original did not create but built out of the inherited bricks of national memory prior to their own time. Reading the Ramayana and Mahabharata even in the form I have given them, we go back to live with our ancient forbears and listen to their grand voice.Mythology is an integral part of religion. It is as necessary for religion and national culture as the skin and the skeleton that preserve a fruit with its juice and its taste. Form is no less essential than substance. Mythology and holy figures are necessary for any great culture to rest on its stable spiritual foundation and function as a life-giving inspiration and guide. Let us keep ever in our minds the fact that it is the Ramayana and the Mahabharata that bind our vast numbers together as one people, despite caste, space and language that seemingly divide them.">

<h2 id="authors-preface">AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>
<p>The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has
added to the debt of gratitude owed it by
undertaking the publication of the English
version of my Tamil Ramayana. They
achieved great success in the distribution
of my Mahabharata book and I trust this
book of the story of Rama and Sita will
receive similar welcome.
Once again, I repeat my confession that
in the evening of my busy life during a
great and eventful period of Indian
history, the writing of these two books
wherein I have retold the Mahabharata
and Ramayana, is, in my opinion, the best
service I have rendered to my people.
At any rate, they embody the best joy I
have experienced; for in these two books I
helped our great sages to speak to our dear
men and women again in their own
language, elevating their minds through
the sorrows borne by Kunti, Kausalya,
Draupadi and Sita. The real need of the
hour is a recommunion between us and
the sages of our land, so that the future
may be built on rock and not on sand.
In presenting this English version to a
wider circle of readers spread all over the
world, I think I am presenting to them the
people of Bharat just as they are, with all
their virtues and their faults. Our classics
really embody our national character in all
its aspects and it is well the world sees us
as we really are, apart from what we wish
to become.
The Ramayana is not history or
biography. It is a part of Hindu
mythology. One cannot understand Hindu
dharma unless one knows Rama and Sita,
Bharata,
Lakshmana,
Ravana,
Kumbhakarna and Hanuman. Mythology
cannot be dispensed with. Philosophy
alone or rituals alone or mythology alone
cannot be sufficient. These are the three
stands of all ancient religions. The attitude
towards things spiritual which belongs to
a particular people cannot be grasped or
preserved or conveyed unless we have all
these three.
The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has
achieved great work by the very wide
distribution organised by it of my
Ramayana and Mahabharata books, which
seek to bring Valmiki and Vyasa near to
those who have no access to the unrivalled
original classics. The characters and
incidents of these two itihasas have come
to be the raw material for the works of
numerous poets and saints that came later
to write dramas and sing poems and
hymns to keep this nation in the straight
path.
Oral discourses have further played
with them in order to entertain and
instruct pious audiences and not a few
variations and additions have been
made to the original. All the languages
of India have the Ramayana and
Mahabharata retold by their poets, with
additions and variations of their own.
They are the records of the mind and
spirit of our forefathers who cared for
the good, ever so much more than for
the pleasant and who saw more of the
mystery of life than we can do in our
interminable pursuit for petty and
illusory achievements ill the material
plane.
We should be thankful to those who
preserved for us these many centuries-old
epics in spite of all the vicissitudes
through which our nation passed since
Vyasa and Valmiki&rsquo;s time. Even the poets
who wrote these epics in the original did
not create but built out of the inherited
bricks of national memory prior to their
own time. Reading the Ramayana and
Mahabharata even in the form I have
given them, we go back to live with our
ancient forbears and listen to their grand
voice.Mythology is an integral part of
religion. It is as necessary for religion and
national culture as the skin and the
skeleton that preserve a fruit with its juice
and its taste. Form is no less essential than
substance. Mythology and holy figures are
necessary for any great culture to rest on
its stable spiritual foundation and function
as a life-giving inspiration and guide.
Let us keep ever in our minds the fact
that it is the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata that bind our vast numbers
together as one people, despite caste,
space and language that seemingly divide
them.</p>
