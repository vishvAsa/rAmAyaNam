      <description>&lt;p&gt;[[श्रीरामविजय-महाकाव्यम्&#x9;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebharatisampat.in/readbook3.php?bookid=ODkyMjU5NDQ4NDM4NDQ3&amp;amp;pageno=MjI0MjQyNjk5NTk=&#34;&gt;EB&lt;/a&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[TABLE]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREFACE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The edition of Rām-Vijaya (Mahākāvya) which describes the heroic exploits of Srī Rāmachandra and his final victory over the Rākṣasas under Rāvaṇa, the king of Laṇkā, is based on the Devānagarī transcript of a single manuscript of the work, obtained through the good offices of Pt. Indranath Jha from the family Collection of the author. The original manuscript (in Maithili) in the hand of the author having not been traceable, I had to content myself with the transcript only which was available to me. The transcript was mostly accurate, except in certain places where the text had to be restored by comparison with and reference to the Sanskrit annotations which accompanied the poem all through. It is not unlikely that in these circumstances some hisreadings have been left unnoticed. But it is to be hoped that with all its shortcomings the work will be welcome to the lovers of Sanskrit poetic literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
